>Contributions that you submit are covered by the [Adobe terms of use.](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html)

### Create an Issue {#create-an-issue}

Do you have a suggestion, observation about the current docs, or question the way something is described? Then please create an issue. Issues are also excellent if you have something to contribute, but don't feel comfortable editing the docs or making a pull request yourself.

Issues allow you to easily describe your idea for improvement to the docs and an AEM Docs Team member can review it. Simply click on the **Log an issue** link at the top of the right navigation panel on any page to create an issue.

### Create a Pull Request {#create-a-pull-request}

If you see a problem and know exactly how to fix it, consider creating a pull request. Pull requests allow you to make your own edits to the documentation, which are then reviewed for inclusion by an AEM Docs Team member. Simply click on the **Edit this page** link at the top of the right navigation panel on any page to make your suggested changes and create the pull request.

If you are an Adobe employee and have a contribution, please use the `AdobeDocs` org in the corporate git.

We of course are happy for any contribution and will review your contribution if it is made on the public repository, however pull requests from Adobe employees are easier to process and can be approved faster on the corporate repo. Please make sure that any proprietary information is only discussed on the corporate repo.
