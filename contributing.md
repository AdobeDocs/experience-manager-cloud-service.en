## How to Contribute

How you contribute depends on who you are and the sort of changes you'd like to contribute:

<!--
We want to make it as easy as possible to submit your contributions. You can contribute in two ways:
--- master
-->

### Create an Issue

Do you have a suggestion, observation about the current docs, or question the way something is described? File an issue. Issues are also excellent if you have something to contirbute, but don't feel comfortable editing the docs or making a pull request yourself.

### Minor Changes

To submit minor updates, click the **Edit** link in an article, which opens the source article in GitHub. Use the GitHub UI to make your updates. See the general [Adobe Docs contributor guide](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/contributor/contributor-guide/introduction.html) for more information.

Minor corrections or clarifications you submit for documentation and code examples in this repo are covered by the Adobe terms of use.

### Major Changes or New Articles from Community Members

If you're part of the Adobe community and want to create an article or submit major changes, click the **Issues** tab in the GitHub repository to submit an issue. This submission starts a conversation with the documentation team. You will need to work with the writer (or other Adobe employee) to publish new content.

If you submit a pull request with significant changes to documentation and code examples, you'll see a message in the pull request asking you to submit an online contribution license agreement (CLA). You must complete the online form before we can review your pull request.

<!--
If you see a problem and know exactly how to fix it, consider creating a pull request. Pull requests allow you to make your own edits to the documentation, which are then reviewed for inclusion by an AEM Docs Team member. Simply click on the **Edit this page** link at the top of the right navigation panel on any page to make your suggested changes and create the pull request.
--master

### Major Changes from Adobe Employees

If you are a technical writer, program manager, or developer from the product team for an Adobe Experience Cloud solution, and it's your job to contribute to or author technical articles, you should use the private repository at `https://git.corp.adobe.com/AdobeDocs`.

Adobe employees from other parts of the Adobe world should use the public repo for minor updates.
