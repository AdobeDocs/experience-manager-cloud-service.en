# The Sites Console {#sites-console}

Learn how to use the Site console to manage and organize your AEM content.

### Locking Your Page (then Unlocking) {#locking-your-page-then-unlocking}

[Locking a page](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.md#locking-a-page) prevents other authors from working on it while you are. The Lock (and Unlock) icon/button can be found:

* The toolbar when your [page has been selected](#selecting-your-page-for-further-action).
* The [Page Information drop-down menu](#editing-the-page-properties) when editing a page.
* The page toolbar when editing a page (when the page is locked)

For example, the lock icon looks like this:

### Accessing Page References {#accessing-page-references}

[Quick access to references](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/environment-tools.md#references) to/from a page are available in the References Rail.

1. Select **References** using the toolbar icon (either before or after [selecting your page](#selecting-your-page-for-further-action)):

   ![References view option](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/references.png)

   A list of reference types is shown:

   ![References view](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/references-list.png)

1. Select the required type of reference to show more details and (when appropriate) take further actions.

### Creating a Version of Your Page {#creating-a-version-of-your-page}

To create a [version](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/features/page-versions.md) of your page:

1. To open the Timeline rail, select **[Timeline](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#timeline)** using the toolbar icon (either before or after [selecting your page](#selecting-your-page-for-further-action)):

   ![Timeline view option](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/timeline.png)

1. Select the ellipsis at the bottom right of the Timeline column to reveal extra buttons, including **Save as Version**.

   ![Timeline view](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/timeline-view.png)

1. Select **Save as Version**, then **Create**.

### Restoring/Comparing a Version of Your Page {#restoring-comparing-a-version-of-your-page}

The same basic mechanism is used when restoring and/or comparing versions of your page:

1. Select **[Timeline](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#timeline)** using the toolbar icon (either before or after [selecting your page](#selecting-your-page-for-further-action)):

   ![Timeline view option](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/timeline.png)

   If a version of your page has already been saved, it is listed in the Timeline.

1. Select the version you want to restore - this will reveal additional action buttons:

    * **Revert to this Version**

        * The version is restored.

    * **Show Differences**

        * The page is opened with differences (between the two versions) highlighted.
