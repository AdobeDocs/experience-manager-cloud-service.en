### Locking Your Page (then Unlocking) {#locking-your-page-then-unlocking}

[Locking a page](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.md#locking-a-page) prevents other authors from working on it while you are. The Lock (and Unlock) icon/button can be found:

* The toolbar when your [page has been selected](#selecting-your-page-for-further-action).
* The [Page Information drop-down menu](#editing-the-page-properties) when editing a page.
* The page toolbar when editing a page (when the page is locked)

For example, the lock icon looks like this:
