# Methods to Author Content in AEM {#authoring-methods}

Learn the different ways you can author content in AEM, how they differ, and when you might use one over the other.

## AEM's Authoring Flexibility {#authoring-flexibility}

AEM as a Cloud Service offers several different models of content authoring to support different use cases.

* [AEM Sites Editor](#sites-editor) - This is the classic editor for authoring content in AEM, tried and trusted for thousands upon thousands of websites.
* [AEM Content Fragment Editor]() - This is the editor of choice for creating headless content.
* [Universal Editor](#universal-editor) - This modern UI allows you to author AEM content in a content-agnostic way and is the first choice for AEM projects leveraging Edge Delivery Services.
* [Document-Based Authoring](#document-based) - If you use Edge Delivery services, you can choose to author your content as conventional documents such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs entirely outside of AEM consoles.

Because of the integrated and scalable nature of AEM, these methods can be use exclusively or in combination with each other depending on the needs of your project.

Check with your system administrator or project manager if you are uncertain which authoring options are available to you.
