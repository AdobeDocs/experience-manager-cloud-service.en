# Sites Console Side Panel {#side-panel}

Learn how to use the side panel in the AEM sites console to better understand and navigate your content.

## Orientation {#orientation}

The side panel is by default closed when you enter the Sites console. In this way the screen is dedicated entirely to your content.

Tap or click the **Side Panel** icon in the sites console toolbar to activate the side panel and choose your view of the content.

* [Content Only](#content-only)
* [Content Tree](#content-tree)
* [Timeline](#timeline)
* [References](#references)
* [Filter](#filter)

## Content Only {#content-only}

This view of the side panel is effectively turning it off, i.e. to show only the content of your site.

Use the grave accent/backtick `Â´` keyboard shortcut to switch to the content only view of the side panel.

## Content Tree {#content-tree}

This view of the side panel displays your content in a tree hierarchy. The content tree can be used to quickly navigate the site hierarchy within the side panel and view much information about the pages in the current folder.

![The content tree view of the side panel](assets/console-side-panel-content-tree.png)

A right-pointing chevron next to an item in the tree indicates a node that can be expanded to reveal its children. Tap or click the chevron to reveal the children.

The console displays the content of the currently-select item in the content tree.

Using the content tree side panel in conjunction with a list view or cards view, users can easily see the hierarchical structure of the project and navigate easily across the content structure with the content tree side-panel, and view detailed page information in the list view.

Use the `Alt+1` keyboard shortcut to switch to the content tree view of the side panel.

>[!TIP]
>
>Once an entry in the hierarchy view is selected, arrow keys can be used to quickly navigate the hierarchy.

## Timeline {#timeline}

The timeline can be used to view and/or initiate events that have occurred on the selected resource.

![Comment field](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/comments.png)

The timeline column lets you view various events related to a selected item selectable as types from a drop-down list:

* Comments
* [Annotations](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/annotations.md)
* [Activities](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/personalization/activities.md)
* [Launches](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/launches/overview.md)
* [Versions](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/features/page-versions.md)
* [Workflows](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/workflows/overview.md)
  * Note that no information will be shown for transient workflows as no history information is saved for these.<!--With the exception of [transient workflows](/help/sites-developing/workflows.md#transient-workflows) as no history information is saved for these-->
* Show All

In addition you can add/view comments about the selected item by using the **Comment** box shown at the bottom of the list of events. Typing a comment followed by `Return` will register the comment. It is shown when **Comments** or **Show All** is selected.

Tn the Sites console you can also access additional features via the elipsis button next to the **Comment** field.
