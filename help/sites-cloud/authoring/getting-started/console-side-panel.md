Learn how to use the side panel in the AEM sites console to better understand and navigate your content.

[Quick access to references](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/environment-tools.md#references) to/from a page are available in the References Rail.

1. Select **References** using the toolbar icon (either before or after [selecting your page](#selecting-your-page-for-further-action)):

   ![References view option](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/references.png)

   A list of reference types is shown:

   ![References view](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/references-list.png)

1. Select the required type of reference to show more details and (when appropriate) take further actions.

### Creating a Version of Your Page {#creating-a-version-of-your-page}

To create a [version](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/features/page-versions.md) of your page:

1. To open the Timeline rail, select **[Timeline](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#timeline)** using the toolbar icon (either before or after [selecting your page](#selecting-your-page-for-further-action)):

   ![Timeline view option](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/timeline.png)

   ![Timeline view](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/timeline-view.png)

1. Select **Save as Version**, then **Create**.

### Restoring/Comparing a Version of Your Page {#restoring-comparing-a-version-of-your-page}

The same basic mechanism is used when restoring and/or comparing versions of your page:

1. Select **[Timeline](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#timeline)** using the toolbar icon (either before or after [selecting your page](#selecting-your-page-for-further-action)):

   ![Timeline view option](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/timeline.png)

   If a version of your page has already been saved, it is listed in the Timeline.

1. Select the version you want to restore - this will reveal additional action buttons:

    * **Revert to this Version**

        * The version is restored.

    * **Show Differences**

        * The page is opened with differences (between the two versions) highlighted.

## References {#references}

**References** shows connections to the selected page:

* Blueprints
* Launches
* Live copies
* Language copies
* Incoming Links
* Use of the reference component: borrowed and lent content

Open the required console, then navigate to the required resource and open **References** using:

![References option](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/references.png)

[Select your required resource](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#viewing-and-selecting-resources) to show a list of references types relevant to that resource:

![References details](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/references-detail.png)

Select the appropriate reference type for more information. In certain situations further actions are available when you select a specific reference, including:

* **Incoming Links**, provides a list of pages that reference the page, together with direct access to **Edit** one of those pages when you select a specific link.

  * This can only show static links, not dynamically generated links; for example, from the List component.

* Instances of borrowed and lent content using the **Reference** component, from here you can navigate to the referencing/referenced page
* [Launches](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/launches/overview.md), provides access to related launches
* [Live Copies](/help/sites-cloud/administering/msm/overview.md) displays the paths of all live copies that are based on the selected resource.

## Events - Timeline {#events-timeline}

For appropriate resources (for example, pages from the **Sites** console, or assets from the **Assets** console) the [timeline can be used to show the recent activity on any selected items](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#timeline).

Open the required console, then navigate to the required resource and open **Timeline**, using:

![Timeline option](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/timeline.png)

[Select your required resource](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#viewing-and-selecting-resources), then either **Show All** or **Activities** to list any recent actions on the selected resources:
