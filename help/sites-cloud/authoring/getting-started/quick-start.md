# Quick Start Guide to Authoring Pages {#quick-guide-to-authoring-pages}

This document is intended as a high-level quick start guide for the key page authoring actions in AEM. This document:

* Is not intended as comprehensive coverage.
* Provides links to the detailed documentation.

For full details about authoring with AEM see:

* [Concepts of Authoring](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/concepts.md)
* [Basic Handling](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md)

## A Few Quick Hints {#a-few-quick-hints}

Before beginning the quick start guide, here is a small collection of general tips and hints that you should bear in mind, divided between areas of the authoring system.

### In the Sites Console {#sites-console}

* Create Button

  * This button is available in many consoles - the options presented are context sensitive so can vary according to the scenario.

* Re-ordering Pages

  * This can be done in [List View](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#list-view). The changes will be applied and be visible in other views.

### Page Authoring {#page-authoring}

* Navigating Links

  * **Links are not available for navigation** when you are in **Edit** mode. To navigate with links you need to [preview the page](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.md#previewing-pages) using either:

    * [Preview Mode](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.md#preview-mode)
    * [View as Published](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.md#view-as-published)

* Versions are not started/created from the page editor. This is now done from the **Sites** console (via either **Create** or [Timeline](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#timeline) for a selected resource).

>There are a number of keyboard shortcuts that can make the authoring experience easier.

### Finding Your Page {#finding-your-page}

There are various aspects to finding a page; you can navigate and/or search:

1. Open the **Sites** console (using the **Sites** option in the [Global Navigation](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#global-navigation) - this is triggered (drop down) when you select the Adobe Experience Manager link (top left).  

1. Navigate down the tree by tapping/clicking on the appropriate page. How the page resources are represented depends on the view you are using - [Card, List, or Column](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#viewing-and-selecting-resources):

   ![View selection drop-down](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/views.png)

1. Navigate up the tree using [the breadcrumb in the header](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#the-header), which allows you to return to the selected location:

   ![Breadcrumb dropdown](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/breadcrumb.png)

        * On a desktop device: use the [quick action](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#quick-actions) represented by the tick icon:

    * The card will be overlaid with a tick to show that the page has been selected.
