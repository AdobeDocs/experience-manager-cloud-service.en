# Basic Handling {#basic-handling}

This document is designed to give an overview of basic handling when using the AEM author environment.

>[!TIP]
>
>Keyboard shortcuts are available throughout AEM. In particular when [using the sites console](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/keyboard-shortcuts.md) and [the page editor](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## A Touch-Enabled UI {#a-touch-enabled-ui}

AEM's user interface is enabled for touch. A touch-enabled interface lets you use touch to interact with the software through gestures such as tap, tap-and-hold, and swipe. Because the AEM UI is touch-enabled, you can use the touch gestures on your touch devices such as your mobile phone or tablet. However mouse actions on a traditional desktop device are also available, giving you flexibility in how you choose to author your content.

## First Steps {#first-steps}

Immediately after logging in you arrive on the [Navigation panel](#navigation-panel). Selecting one of the options opens the respective console.

![Navigation panel](assets/basic-handling-navigation.png)

To get a good understanding of the basic use of AEM, this document is based on the **Sites** console. Select on **Sites** to get started.

## Product Navigation {#product-navigation}

Whenever a user first accesses a console, a product navigation tutorial is started. Take a minute to select through to get a good overview of the basic handling of AEM.

![Navigation tutorial](assets/basic-navigation-console-tutorial.png)

Select **Next** to advance to the next page of the overview. Select **Close** or select outside of the overview dialog to close.

The overview will restart the next time you access a console unless you either view all slides or check the option **Don't show this again**.

## Global Navigation {#global-navigation}

You can navigate between the consoles using the global navigation panel. This is triggered as a full-screen drop-down when you select the **Adobe Experience Manager** link at the top-left of the screen.

You can close the global navigation panel by clicking or tapping **Close** to return to your previous location.

![Navigation panel top bar](assets/basic-handling-navigation-bar.png)

Global navigation has two panels, represented by icons at the left-margin of the screen:

* **[Navigation](#navigation-panel)** - Represented by a compass and the default panel when you log in to AEM
* **[Tools](#tools-panel)** - Represented by a hammer

The options available on these panels are described below.

### Navigation Panel {#navigation-panel}

The **Navigation** panel:

![Navigation panel](assets/basic-handling-navigation.png)

The title of the browser tab will update to reflect your location as you navigate through the consoles and content.

From Navigation the consoles available are:

|Console|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Projects|The Projects console gives you direct access to your projects. [Projects are virtual dashboards](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/projects/overview.md) that can be used to build a team. You can then give that team access to resources, workflows, and tasks, thus allowing people to work towards a common goal.|
|Sites|The Sites consoles let you [create, view, and manage sites](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/organizing-pages.md) running on your AEM instance. Through this console you can create, edit, copy, move, and delete pages, start workflows, and publish pages.|
|Experience Fragments|An [Experience Fragment](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/experience-fragments.md) is a stand-alone experience that can be re-used across channels and have variations, saving the trouble of repeatedly copying and pasting experiences or parts of experiences.|
|Assets|The Assets console lets you import and manage [digital assets such as images, videos, documents, and audio files](/help/assets/overview.md). These assets can then be used by any site running on the same AEM instance. You can also create and manage [Content Fragments](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments.md) from the Assets console.|
|Personalization|This console provides a framework of tools for [authoring targeted content and presenting personalized experiences](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/personalization/overview.md).|
|Content Fragments|[Content Fragments](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/overview.md) allow you to design, create, curate and publish page-independent content. They allow you to prepare structured content ready for use in multiple locations/over multiple channels, and ideal for both page authoring and headless delivery.|

## Tools Panel {#tools-panel}

In the **Tools** panel has a side panel containing a range of categories, that group together similar consoles. The **Tools** consoles provide access to several specialized tools and consoles that help you administer your websites, digital assets, and other aspects of your content repository. <!--The [Tools consoles](/help/sites-administering/tools-consoles.md) provide access to several specialized tools and consoles that help you administer your websites, digital assets, and other aspects of your content repository.-->
