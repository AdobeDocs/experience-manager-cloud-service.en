# Editing Page Properties {#editing-page-properties}

You can define the required properties for a page. These can vary depending on the nature of the page. For example some pages might be connected to a live copy while others are not and the live copy information will be available as appropriate.

## Page Properties {#page-properties}

The properties are distributed across several tabs.

### Basic {#basic}

* **Title &amp; Tags**

  * **Title** - The title of the page is shown in various locations. For example, the **Websites** tab list and the **Sites** card/list views.
    * This is a mandatory field.
  * **Tags** - Here you can add, or remove tags from the page by updating the list in the selection box.
    * After selecting a tag is it listed below the selection box. You can remove a tag from this list using the x.
    * A completely new tag can be entered by typing the name in an empty selection box.
      * The new tag will be created when you hit enter.
      * The new tag will then be shown with a small star on the right indicating that it is a new tag.
    * With the drop-down functionality you can select from existing tags.
    * An x appears when you mouse-over a tag entry in the selection box, which can be used to remove that tag for this page.
    * For more information about tags, see [Using Tags](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/features/tags.md).
  * **Hide in Navigation** - Indicates whether the page is shown or hidden in the page navigation of the resulting site.

* **Branding**

  Apply a consistent brand identity across pages by appending a brand slug to each page title. This functionality requires use of the Page Component from release 2.14.0 or later of the [Core Components.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/introduction.html)

  * **Override** - Check to define the brand slug on this page.
    * The value will be inherited by any child pages unless they also have their **Override** values set.
  * **Override value** - The text of the brand slug to be appended to the page title.
    * The value is appended to the page title after a pipe character such as "Cycling Tuscany | Always ready for the WKND"

* **HTML ID**

  * **ID** - HTML ID to apply to the component.

* **More Titles and Description**

  * **Page Title** - A title to be used on the page. Typically used by title components. If empty the **Title** will be used.
  * **Navigation Title** - You can specify a separate title for use in the navigation (for example, if you want something more concise). If empty, the **Title** will be used.
  * **Subtitle** - A subtitle for use on the page.
  * **Description** - Your description of the page, its purpose, or any other details you want to add.

* **On/Off Time**

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  > See [On and Off Times - Trigger Configuration](/help/operations/replication.md#on-and-off-times-trigger-configuration) for details of how to configure the related automatic replication.

  >[!NOTE]
  >If either the **On Time** or **Off Time** is in the past, and automatic replication is configured, then the relevant action will be triggered immediately.

  * **On Time** - The date and time at which the published page will be made visible (rendered) on the publish environment. The page must be published, either manually or by pre-configured auto-replication.

    * If already [published (manually)](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/publishing-pages.md) this page will be kept dormant (hidden) until rendering at the specified time.
    * If not published, and configured for auto-replication, the page will be automatically published, then rendered, at the specified time.
    * If not published, and not configured for auto-replication, the page will not be automatically published, so a 404 will be seen when an attempt to access the page is made.
  
  * **Off Time** - Similar to and often used in combination with **On Time**, this defines the time at which the published page will be hidden on the publish environment.

  * Leave these fields (**On Time** and **Off Time**) empty for pages you want to publish immediately and have available on the publish environment until they are deactivated (the normal scenario).

* **Vanity URL**

  * Allows you to enter a vanity URL for this page, which can allow you to have a shorter and/or more expressive URL.
  * For example, if the Vanity URL is set to `welcome` to the page identified by the path `/v1.0/startpage` for the website `http://example.com`, then `http://example.com/welcome` would be the vanity URL of `http://example.com/content/v1.0/startpage`
  
  >[!CAUTION]
  >
  >Vanity URLs:
  >
  >* Must be unique so you should take care that the value is not already used by another page.
  >* Do not support regex patterns.
  >* Should not be set to an existing page.

  * **Add** - Tap or click to show a field to define a vanity URL for the page.
    * Tap or click again to add multiple.
    * Tap or click the **Remove** icon to delete the vanity URL.
  * **Redirect Vanity URL** - Indicates whether you want the page to use the vanity URL.

### Advanced {#advanced}

* **Settings**

  * **Language** - The page language
  * **Language Root** - Must be checked if the page is the root of a language copy
  * **Redirect** - Indicates the page to which this page should automatically redirect with an HTML `302 Found` status. 
    * **Permanent Redirect** - When checked, the page redirects to the target path provided along with an HTML `301 Moved Permanently` status.
  * **Design** - Indicates whether the page is shown or hidden in the page navigation of the resulting site
  * **Alias** - Specifies an alias to be used with this page
    * For example, if you define an alias of `private` for the page `/content/wknd/us/en/magazine/members-only`, then this page can also be accessed via `/content/wknd/us/en/magazine/private`
    * Creating an alias sets the `sling:alias` property on the page node, which only impacts the resource, not the repository path.
    * Pages accessed by aliases in the editor can not be published. [Publish options](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/publishing-pages.md) in the editor are only available for pages accessed via their actual paths.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Bulk editing of properties is also available for Assets. It is very similar, but differs in a few points. See Editing Properties of Multiple Assets for details.
>
>There is also the Bulk Editor, which allows you to search for content from multiple pages using GQL (Google Query Language) and then edit the content directly in the bulk editor before saving your changes to the originating pages.

<!--

-->

You can select multiple pages for bulk editing by various methods, including:

* When browsing the **Sites** console
* After using **Search** to locate a set of pages

After selecting the pages and then clicking or tapping the **Properties option**, the bulk properties will be shown:

![Bulk editing page properties](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/page-properties-bulk-edit.png)

You can only bulk edit pages that:

* Share the same resource type
* Are not part of a livecopy
  * If any of the pages are in a live copy then a message will be shown when the properties are opened.

Once you have entered Bulk Editing you can:

* **View**

  * A list of the pages impacted
    * You can select/deselect if required
    * Tabs
      * As when viewing properties for a single page, the properties are ordered under tabs.
  * A subset of properties
    * Properties that are available on all selected pages and have been explicitly defined as available to bulk editing are visible.
    * If you reduce the page selection to one page, then all properties are visible.
  * Common properties with a common value
    * Only properties with a common value are shown in View mode.
    * When the field is multi-value (for example Tags), values will only be shown when *all* are common. If only some are common, they will only be shown when editing.
    * When no properties with a common value exist, a message is displayed.

* **Edit**

  * You can update the values in the fields available.
    * The new values will be applied to all selected pages when you select **Done**.
    * When the field is multi-value (for example Tags), you can either append a new value or remove a common value.
  * Fields that are common, but have different values across the various pages will be indicated with a special value such as the text `<Mixed Entries>`. Care should be taken when editing such fields to prevent data loss.
