# Path Selection {#path-selection}

Often when authoring it is necessary to select another resource such as when defining a link to another page or selecting an image. To easily select a path, [path fields](#path-fields) offer auto-complete and the [path browser](#path-browser) allows for more robust selection.

## Path Fields {#path-fields}

The example used here to illustrate is the image component. For more information about using and editing components see [Components for Page Authoring.](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/components.md)

Path fields have auto-complete and look-ahead functionality to make locating a resource easier.

Clicking the **Open Selection Dialog** button in the path field opens the [path browser](#path-browser) dialog to allow for more detailed selection options.

Alternatively you can start typing in the path field and AEM will offer matching paths as you type.

## Path Browser {#path-browser}

The path browser is organized like the [column view](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.md#column-view) of the [**Sites** console,](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/getting-started/sites-console.md) allowing for more detailed selection of resources.

* Once a resource is selected, the **Select** button at the upper-right of the dialog box becomes active.
  * Select to confirm the selection or **Cancel** to abort.
* If the context allows for the selection of multiple resources, selecting a resource also activates the **Select** button, but also adds a count of the number of selected resources to the upper-right of the window.
  * Click the **X** next to the number to deselect all.
* When you navigate through the tree, your location is reflected in the breadcrumbs at the top of the dialog.
  * These breadcrumbs can also be used to quickly jump within the resource hierarchy.
* At any time you can use the search field at the top of the dialog box.
  * Click the **X** in the search field to clear the search.
* To narrow your search, you can reveal the filter options and filter your results based on a certain path.
