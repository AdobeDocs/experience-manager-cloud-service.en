# Use the Rich Text Editor to author content {#use-rich-text-editor-to-author-content}

The Rich Text Editor (RTE) is a basic building block for inserting textual content into AEM. It forms the basis of various components

## In-place editing {#in-place-editing}

Selecting a text-based component with a single tap or click will reveal the [component toolbar](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.md#component-toolbar) as with any component.

Tapping/clicking agin or initially selecting the component with a slow double-tap/click will open in-place editing, which has its own toolbar. Here you can edit the content and make basic formatting changes.

This toolbar provides the following options:

* **Format**: Emphasize text as bold or italic or underline the text.
* **Lists**: Create bulleted or numbered lists and set the indentation.
* **Hyperlink**: Create links.
* **Unlink**: Remove hyperlink.
* **Full Screen**: Open the editor in fullscreen mode.
* **Close**: Stop editing.
* **Save**: Save changes.

## Full screen editing {#full-screen-editing}

For text-based components, tap the full-screen mode ![RTE full screen button](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/editing-full-screen.png) from the [toolbar](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.md#component-toolbar) to open the rich text editor and hides the rest of the page content.

Full screen mode displays all the configured options that you can use for authoring. The availability of options depends on the configuration. <!--Full screen mode displays all the configured options that you can use for authoring.

>Copying nested lists from Microsoft Word into the RTE can give inconsistent results. Instead, paste as text and do manual adjustment.
