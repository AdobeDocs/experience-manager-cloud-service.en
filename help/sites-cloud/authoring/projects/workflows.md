# Working with Project Workflows {#working-with-project-workflows}

The project workflows available out of the box include the following:

* **Project Approval Workflow** - This workflow allows you to assign content to a user, review, then approve.
* **Request Launch** - A workflow the requests a launch.
* **Request Landing Page** - This workflow requests a landing page.
* **Request Email** - Workflow for requesting an email.
* **DAM Create and Translate Copy and DAM Create Language Copy** - Creates translated binaries, metadata, and tags for assets and folders.

Depending on which Project template you select, you have certain workflows available:

|   |**Simple Project**|**Translation Project**|
|---|:-:|:-:|
|Project Approval Workfow|x |  |
|Request Launch |x |  |
|Request Landing Page |x |  |
|Request Email |x | |
|DAM Create Language Copy&ast; |  |x |
|DAM Create and Translate Language Copy&ast; |   |x |

>[!NOTE]
>
>&ast; These workflows are not started from the **Workflow** tile in Projects. See [Creating Language Copies for Assets.](/help/sites-cloud/administering/translation/managing-projects.md)

The steps for starting and completing workflows are the same no matter which workflow you choose. Only the steps change.

You start a workflow directly in Projects (except for DAM Create Language Copy or DAM Create and Translate Language Copy). Information on any outstanding tasks in a project are listed in the **Tasks** tile. Notifications for tasks that need to be completed appear next to the user icon.

For more information on working with workflows in AEM, see the following:
