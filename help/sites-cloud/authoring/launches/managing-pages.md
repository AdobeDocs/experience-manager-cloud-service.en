# Managing Pages within your Launch {#managing-pages-in-launch}

With launches you can both:

* [Manage new content in existing pages](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/launches/editing.md),
* [Add new pages to](#add-pages-to-launch), or [delete unwanted pages from](#remove-pages-from-launch), a launch,
* Navigate within the structure of a launch.

## Add Pages to Your Launch {#add-pages-to-launch}

## Remove Pages from Your Launch {#remove-pages-from-launch}

## Navigate the Structure of Your Launch {#navigate-structure-of-launch}

You can navigate through the structure of your launch from:

* The Page Editor:
  You can either
  * **Leave** the launch and return to editing the source page
  * **Navigate** the structure of the Launch

* The **Launches** Console:
  If you select a specific launch, you can then select **Manage Content**:
  ![Launch Console - Manage Content](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/launches-navigate-console.png)
  This will open the launch in the Sites console, where you can:
  * navigate, 
  * **Create** new pages,
  * select existing pages and take action; for example, **Edit**, open **Properties**, **Lock**, **Copy**, **Paste** and **Delete**
