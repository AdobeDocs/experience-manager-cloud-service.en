# Managing Pages within your Launch {#managing-pages-in-launch}

With launches you can both:

* [Manage new content in existing pages](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/launches/editing.md),
* [Navigate through the structure of a launch in the Sites console](#navigate-structure-of-launch),
* From the console [Add new pages to](#add-pages-to-launch), or [delete unwanted pages from](#remove-pages-from-launch), a launch,
* Take other standard actions on pages within the launch.

## Navigate the Structure of Your Launch {#navigate-structure-of-launch}

You can navigate through the structure of your launch from:

* The Page Editor:
  
  * Select **Navigate** to open the structure of the Launch in the console:

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >You can also:
    >
    >* **Leave** the launch and return to editing the source page

* The **Launches** Console:
  If you select a specific launch, you can then select **Manage Content**:
  ![Launch Console - Manage Content](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/launches-navigate-launches-console.png)

* The **Sites** Console:
  If you select a specific source page and open **References**, you can then select **Launches** followed by **Manage Content**:

All of these entry points opens the launch in the Sites console, where you can:
