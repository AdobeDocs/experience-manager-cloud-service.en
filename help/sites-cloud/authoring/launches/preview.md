# Preview with Timewarp {#preview-with-timewarp}

[Timewarp](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/console/page-versions.md#timewarp) can be used with pages that are also included in a launch:

1. When selecting **Timewarp** mode from the page editor, you are asked for a date. Select a date that is after the promotion date of the launch:
   ![Navigate launch from Page Editor](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/launches-timewarp-01.png)

1. The content appropriate at that date is shown:
   ![Navigate launch from Page Editor](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/assets/launches-timewarp-02.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Whichever launch has the live date closest to - and before - the date selected is applicable and its content is shown.
