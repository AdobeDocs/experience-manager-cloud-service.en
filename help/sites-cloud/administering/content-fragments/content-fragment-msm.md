# Reuse Content Fragments using MSM {#reuse-content-fragments-using-msm}

[Multi Site Manager (MSM)](/help/sites-cloud/administering/msm/overview.md) functionality in Adobe Experience Manager enables users to reuse content that is authored once and then reused across multiple web-locations. 

The same functionality is also available for digital assets under the name [MSM for Assets](/help/assets/reuse-assets-using-msm.md). 

As Content Fragments are a Sites feature, but stored as Assets the functionality is also available for Content Fragments.

Using MSM for Content Fragments you can:

* Create Content Fragments once and then make (linked) copies of these fragments to reuse in other areas of the site.
* Keep multiple copies synchronized by updating the source copy once, then pushing the changes to the (live) copies.
* Make local changes by temporarily, or permanently, suspending the link between parent and child fragments.
