# Content Fragments Console  {#content-fragments-console}

Learn how the Content Fragments console optimizes access to your Content Fragments, helping you create, search, and manage them by taking administrative actions such as publish, unpublish, copy.

The Content Fragments console is dedicated to managing, searching for, and creating Content Fragments. It has been optimized for use in a Headless context, but is also used when creating Content Fragments for use in page authoring.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This console only displays Content Fragments. It does not display other asset types such as images and videos. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Access to your Content Fragments is currently possible via:
>
>* this **Content Fragments** console
>* the **Assets** console - see [Managing Content Fragments](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-managing.md)

>[!NOTE]
>
>A selection of [keyboard shortcuts are available for use in this console](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/content-fragments-console-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

The Content Fragments console can be directly accessed from the top level of the Global Navigation:
