# Analyzing Content Fragment Structure {#analyzing-content-fragments-structure}

Content Fragments are designed for [Headless delivery using GraphQL](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/content-delivery-with-graphql.md). This means that they can have a multi-layered structure. 

Experience Manager (AEM) provides several methods of viewing and analyzing the structure of your fragments.

## References {#references}

The structure is built up using References:

* [Data types for References are defined in the Content Fragment Model](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/content-fragment-models.md#using-references-to-form-nested-content)
* When authoring you can:
  * [Manage these references](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/authoring.md##manage-references)
  * [Find Parent References of your Fragment](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/managing.md#parent-references-fragment)

## Structure tree {#structure-tree}

Open the **Structure tree** tab from the editor toolbar to show the hierarchical structure of the Content Fragment, and its references. Use the link icon to open references.

For example:
