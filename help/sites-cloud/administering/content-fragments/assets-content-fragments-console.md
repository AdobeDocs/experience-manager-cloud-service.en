# Viewing and Managing Assets in the Content Fragments Console {#viewing-managing-assets-content-fragments-console}

By default, the [Content Fragments console](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/managing.md#content-fragments-console) of Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service presents your [Content Fragments](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/overview.md). 

However, you can also view, and manage, all other sorts of **Assets** in this **Content Fragments Console**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Content Fragments can also be accessed from the **[Assets](/help/assets/overview.md)** console.

## Viewing Assets {#viewing-assets}

You can use the far left panel of the Content Fragments console to select  **Assets** as the resource type to view, browse and manage:
