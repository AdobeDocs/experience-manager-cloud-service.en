# Viewing and Managing Assets in the Content Fragments Console {#viewing-managing-assets-content-fragments-console}

By default, the [Content Fragments console](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/managing.md#content-fragments-console) of Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service presents your [Content Fragments](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/overview.md). 

However, you can also view, and manage, all other sorts of **Assets** in this **Content Fragments Console**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Content Fragments can also be accessed from the **[Assets](/help/assets/overview.md)** console.

## Viewing Assets {#viewing-assets}

You can use the far left panel of the Content Fragments console to select  **Assets** as the resource type to view, browse and manage:

>Although Content Fragments are stored as Assets, they are not listed in this view.

## Managing Assets {#managing-assets}

From the **Assets** view of the Content Fragments console you can:

![Content Fragments console - browse Asset](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/assets/cf-console-assets-browse.png)

* Navigate the structure and browse your Assets; [similar to the functionality in the Assets console](/help/assets/navigate-assets-view.md)
* [Create a folder](/help/assets/manage-digital-assets.md#creating-folders)
* [Upload Assets](/help/assets/add-delete-assets-view.md)
* Configure the view type (List, Grid, Gallery, Waterfall); and when appropriate the columns visible

You can also take actions on one, or more, selected Assets:
