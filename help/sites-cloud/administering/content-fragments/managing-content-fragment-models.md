# Managing Content Fragment Models {#managing-content-fragment-models}

From the Content Fragment console you can manage your Content Fragment Models, then [open the editor](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/content-fragment-models.md) to define the structure.

Content Fragment Models in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service define the structure for the content of your [Content Fragments](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/overview.md). These fragments can then be used as a foundation for your headless content, or for page authoring.
