A rollout depends on the synchronization actions defined in the specific rollout configuration. Some actions are dependent on modifications to the content. However, there are also many actions that are not dependent on modifications to the content, but are dependent on events such as page activation. Such events do not modify the content, but do modify the internal properties related to the content.

The status fields are also dependent on the synchronization actions defined in the specific rollout configuration and indicate whether there have been any such actions to either the blueprint or the Live Copy since the last successful rollout. A status field will only reflect the actions in the specific rollout configuration. If no successful rollout has been ever been performed on a Live Copy, then the status will always show up-to-date.

For example, a rollout configuration is defined as `targetActivate`. Therefore, a rollout will depend solely on activation events. The status field will only indicate whether any activation events have occurred since the last successful rollout.

The **Live Copy Overview** can also be used to perform actions on the Live Copy:

1. Open the **Live Copy Overview**.
1. Select the required blueprint or Live Copy page and the toolbar will be updated to show the available actions. The [actions](overview.md#terms-used) available depend on whether you select a [blueprint](#actions-for-a-blueprint-page) or [Live Copy](#actions-for-a-live-copy-page) page.

### Actions for a Blueprint Page {#actions-for-a-blueprint-page}
