# Using the GraphiQL IDE {#graphiql-ide}

An implementation of the standard [GraphiQL](https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/#graphiql) IDE is available for use with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service GraphQL. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>GraphiQL is included in AEM, but by default it is only enabled on the `dev-authors` environments.


The **GraphiQL** tool allows you to:
* test and debug your GraphQL queries by:
  * directly inputting queries
  * running your queries to immediately see the the results
  * managing **Query Variables** and **Request Headers**
*  select the **Endpoint** appropriate to your Sites configuration.
* save, and manage, **[Persisted Queries](/help/headless/graphql-api/persisted-queries.md)**
* see the **History** of your previous queries
* use the **Documentation Explorer** to access the documentation; helping you to learn and understand what methods are available.

The query editor itself also:
* uses mouse-over to show you additional information about elements
* provides features such as syntax-highlighting, auto-complete, auto-suggest

For example: 

* `http://localhost:4502/content/graphiql.html`
