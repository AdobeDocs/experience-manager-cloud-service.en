# Introduction to Adobe Experience Manager as a Headless CMS {#introduction-aem-headless}

Learn how to use Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Headless CMS, with features such as Content Models, Content Fragments, and a GraphQL API that power headless experiences at scale.

You can read detailed documentation of the various features involved and/or follow the selection of [Headless Journeys to get an overview of the first steps](#first-steps).

>[!NOTE]

>See also [What is Headless?](/help/headless/what-is-headless.md) for an introduction to Headless concepts and terminology.

## Overview {#overview}

AEM Headless is a CMS solution from Experience Manager that allows structured content (Content Fragments) in AEM to be consumed by any app over HTTP using GraphQL. Headless implementations enable delivery of experiences across platforms and channels at scale.

Headless implementation forgoes page and component management as is traditional in full stack and hybrid solutions and focuses on the creation of channel-neutral, reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery. It is a modern and dynamic development pattern for implementing web experiences.

## Comparing Headful and Headless {#headful-headless}

This guide focuses on the full headless implementation model of AEM. However headful versus headless need not be a binary choice in AEM. Headless features can be used to manage and deliver content to multiple touch-points, while also enabling content authors to edit single page applications. All in AEM.
