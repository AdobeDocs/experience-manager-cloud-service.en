# Introduction to Adobe Experience Manager as a Headless CMS {#introduction-aem-headless}

Learn how to use Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Headless CMS (Content Management System), with features such as Content Fragment Models, Content Fragments, and a GraphQL API that together power headless experiences at scale.

You can read detailed documentation of the various features involved and/or follow the selection of [Headless Journeys to get an overview of the first steps](#first-steps).

## Overview {#overview}

AEM Headless is a CMS solution from Experience Manager that allows structured content (Content Fragments) in AEM to be consumed by any app over HTTP using GraphQL. Headless implementations enable delivery of experiences across platforms and channels at scale.

Headless implementation forgoes page and component management, as is traditional in full stack and hybrid solutions. Instead it focuses on the creation of channel-neutral, reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery. It is a modern and dynamic development pattern for implementing web experiences.

## Features {#aem-headless-features}

AEM as a Cloud Service is a flexible tool for the headless implementation model by offering three powerful features:

1. **Content Fragment Models**
   * Content Fragment Models are structured representations of content.
   * Content Fragment Models are defined by information architects in the AEM Content Fragment Model editor.
   * Content Fragment Models serve as a basis for Content Fragments.
1. **Content Fragments**
   * A Content Fragment is created based on a Content Fragment Model.
   * Content Fragments are created by content authors, using the AEM Content Fragment editor.
   * Content Fragments are stored as AEM Assets, but can be managed through either the Assets Console, or the [Content Fragments Console](/help/sites-cloud/administering/content-fragments/overview.md#content-fragments-console).
1. **Content API for delivery**
   * The AEM GraphQL API supports Content Fragment delivery.
   * The AEM Assets REST API supports Content Fragment CRUD operations.
   * Direct content delivery is also possible with the [JSON export of the Content Fragment Core Component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/components/content-fragment-component.html).

## Comparing Headful and Headless {#headful-headless}

This guide focuses on the full headless implementation model of AEM. However, headful versus headless does not need to be a binary choice in AEM. Headless features can be used to manage and deliver content to multiple touch-points, while also enabling content authors to edit single page applications. All in AEM.
