# What is a Headless CMS? {#what-is-headless}

A Headless Content Management System (CMS) is a key development for today's web design.

But what does the term really mean? And what are the alternatives? And what are the advantages? And when would you actually want to use a Headless CMS? 

Here we offer a (very quick) introduction to the key concepts.

## What is a Content Management System (CMS)? {#content-management-system}

Let's start with the basics - what is a Content Management System?

A Content Management System (CMS) is just what it says it is - a computer system used to manage content. Thatâ€™s a bit general, so to be more precise, it is (typically) used for managing content that you want to make available on your website(s).

## Headless CMS {#headless-cms}

As this is the main focus, we'll start with headless and a classic definition (not quite chronological order, but we'll cover the other terms later):

* "*A headless content management system, or headless CMS, is a back-end only content management system (CMS) built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via an API for display on any device.*

  See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system).

But what does that really mean?

Headless is a term used to describe a system that effectively detaches the content from the manner of displaying that content on the web. 

[Traditionally you would manage your content in a CMS](#traditional-cms), and the same CMS would be responsible for rendering that content on your webpages.

Now, headless means that your content-set can be managed in the CMS and then accessed by one, or more, (independent) applications. To simplify these interfaces, the headless content:

* is structured - so the retrieving app knows what to request, and how
* does not include any formatting, this will be handled by the retrieving app
* will be automatically retrieved by means of APIs

Headless means that your content can be delivered to any device, in a wide range of formats. This makes the whole process much more flexible, and also means that you do not need to worry about layout and formatting.

## Headless APIs {#headless-apis}

These APIs form, and define, the mechanisms for the independent apps to reference, and retrieve, content from the Headless CMS. To enable the query mechanism, the headless content needs to have a predefined structure that the app can reference.

## Traditional CMS {#traditional-cms}

As mentioned previously, a Traditional CMS is one that allows you to manage your content, and then renders it for you too. An all-in-one package, usually focused on web-page creation. 

Very powerful, giving you full control of the content and formatting, but missing some of the flexibility needed in today's fast-moving environment; for example, when interfacing with external apps.

### Headful CMS {#headful-cms}

This is another term for a traditional CMS.

## Decoupled CMS {#decoupled-cms}

You might not have noticed the phrase "*built from the ground up*" in the definition of a Headless CMS. Technically it's crucial to the Headless definition - so the term Decoupled covers the gap. 

A Decoupled CMS is basically a Traditional CMS that can also be used for providing Headless functionality. However, as the differentiation is basically a technical aspect, it is very common for a Decoupled CMS to be simply described as Headless as it delivers the functionality. It would be difficult to rate Decoupled versus (fully) Headless systems, as both have advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses - it all depends on the individual CMS and how easily, reliably they deliver the headless functionality.
