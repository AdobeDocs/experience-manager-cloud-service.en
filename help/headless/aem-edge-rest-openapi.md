In Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service, the AEM Edge Delivery Services REST OpenAPI:

* is a HTTP REST API on [AEM Edge Delivery Services](/help/edge/overview.md), designed to deliver structured content in JSON format

* focuses on content delivery (performance, scalability, CDN integration, optimized JSON control and output) 
* includes the ability to hydrate JSON for referenced fragments and assets

This API:
