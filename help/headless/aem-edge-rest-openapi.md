# AEM Edge Delivery Services REST OpenAPI {#aem-edge-delivery-services-rest-openapi}

In Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service, the AEM Edge Delivery Services REST OpenAPI is:

* a HTTP REST API on AEM Edge Delivery Services, designed to deliver structured content in JSON format
  * using the infrastructure of Edge Delivery Services, including CDN integration that allows active invalidation 
* equivalent to the [Content Fragments and Content Fragment Models OpenAPIs](/help/headless/content-fragment-openapis.md)
  * now with focus on content delivery (performance, scalability, CDN integration, optimized JSON control and output) 
* the successor to [Content Fragments Support in the AEM Assets HTTP API](/help/assets/content-fragments/assets-api-content-fragments.md)
  * now including the ability to hydrate JSON for referenced fragments and assets
* a HTTP REST alternative to the [AEM GraphQL API for use with Content Fragments](/help/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments.md)
