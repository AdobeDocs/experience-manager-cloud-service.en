## The Onboarding Process {#onboarding-process}

After signing the contract, the Adobe Managed Services (AMS) initiates the customer onboarding. During the provisioning phase where AMS provisions the AMS instance following the contract, AMS-Screens-Cloud Feature Pack is installed. The Feature Pack allows Screens Services Provider to connect to the AMS instance  or Screens Content Provider.
