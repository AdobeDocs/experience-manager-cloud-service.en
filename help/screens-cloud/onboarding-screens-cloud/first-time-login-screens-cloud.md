# First Time Login to Screens as a Cloud Service {#first-time-login-screens-cloud}


## The Onboarding Process {#onboarding-process}

After signing the contract, the Adobe Managed Services (AMS) initiates the customer onboarding. During the provisioning phase, when AMS provisions the AMS instance following the contract, the AMS-Screens-Cloud Feature Pack is installed. The Feature Pack allows Screens Services Provider to connect to the AMS instance  or Screens Content Provider. 

## Adding Users to Adobe Admin Console {#admin-console}

Once you have been provisioned with an Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) Organization ID, you can now access [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/). Refer to [Adobe Admin Console users](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/users.ug.html) to learn more about adding users to the Admin Console.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The users have access to AEM Cloud Service Product profile so that they can login to AEM using the Adobe ID or Federated ID.

## What's Next {#whats-next}

Now that you have been provisioned with an IMS Organization ID and added as a user to the Adobe Admin Console, you can now add Screens as an [add-on to a new program](/help/screens-cloud/onboarding-screens-cloud/add-on-new-program-screens-cloud.md) or to [an existing program](/help/screens-cloud/onboarding-screens-cloud/add-on-existing-program-screens-cloud.md) in Cloud Manager.
