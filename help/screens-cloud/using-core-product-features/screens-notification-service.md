### Overview

AEM Screens Notifications Service allows administrators to receive an email if an AEM screens player does not ping for a configurable period of time.

### How to configure

On AEM Screens Cloud, customers can request alerts on device inactivity status by creating a support ticket with following information:

* Customer Name
* IMS OrgID
* Schedule Frequency: Specify a time or frequency in hours (for example, 1) at which this monitor should send emails.
* Ping Timeout: Specifies the interval in minutes after which a device should be considered not reachable.
* Email ID(s) : Email id(s) where the report will be sent
