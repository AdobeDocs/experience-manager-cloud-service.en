## Understanding Components in Screens as a Cloud Service {#understanding-components}

Screens as a Cloud Service has two main components, namely:

* **Content Provider**, which is the Screens add-on running on AEM Cloud Service or on Adobe Managed Services (AMS). Screens Content Provider allows the content author to create and manage channels. The content authors can add new content, edit the content without worrying about the details of creating displays or player registration. The Content Provider provides an abstraction from the underlying details of developing content, displays, or player registration. 

* **Services Provider**, which is the digital signage management service running on Adobe I/O runtime. Screens Services Provider allows the content author, developers, and administrators to manage displays and players for content playback once the content is added to the channels. Additionally, Screens Services Provider informs the orchestrator where and when content is going to play at a high-level.
