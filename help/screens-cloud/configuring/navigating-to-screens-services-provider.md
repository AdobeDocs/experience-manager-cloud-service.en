1.  Click **Save** to connect to Screens content provider.

1. In you have configured the AEM publish instance to allow access only to trusted IP addresses by Cloud Manager's IP Allowlist feature, you need to configure a header with a key value in the settings dialog as shown below.
The IPs which need to whitelisted also need to moved to the configuration file and need to be [unapplied](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/ip-allow-lists/apply-allow-list) from the Cloud Manager settings.

The same key needs to be configured at  AEM CDN configuration.  It is recommended to not put the header value directly in GITHub and use a [secret reference](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/cdn-credentials-authentication#rotating-secrets).
A sample [CDN config](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/security/traffic-filter-rules-including-waf) is given below:
    kind: "CDN"
        version: "1"
        metadata:
          envTypes: ["dev", "stage", "prod"]
        data:
          trafficFilters:
            rules:
              - name: "block-request-from-not-allowed-ips"
                when:
                  allOf:
                    - reqProperty: clientIp
                      notIn: ["101.41.112.0/24"]
                     reqProperty: tier
                      equals: publish
                action: block
              - name: "allow-requests-with-header"
                when:
                  allOf:
                    - reqProperty: tier
                      equals: publish
                    - reqProperty: path
                      equals: /screens/channels.json
                    - reqHeader: x-screens-allowlist-key
                      equals: $\
        {CDN_HEADER_KEY}
                action:
                  type: allow
