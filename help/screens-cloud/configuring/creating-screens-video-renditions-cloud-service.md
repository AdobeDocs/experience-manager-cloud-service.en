   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >Use the Encoding name that starts with "screens-". Only these video renditions are considered to play the video experience in Screens as a Cloud Service. Enter the bitrate that works your videos (2500 kbps for 720-px video and 5000 kbps for 1080 px).

   >[!NOTE]
   >Multiple video renditions can be added with varying width/height/bitrate to work your videos. All the screens, renditions are downloaded by the Screens devices, even though the device plays only video rendition.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Select the Processing profile and click **Apply Profile to Folders**.

   ![Apply Profile to Folder](/help/screens-cloud/assets/configure/screens-video-5.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* You can create multiple Processing profiles and apply them to the corresponding folders, so that the videos in those folders get the specific video renditions.
   >* When you upload any videos to the folder where a Processing profile is applied, videos are processed. Configured renditions are created, which are used by the Screens devices to play the videos.
