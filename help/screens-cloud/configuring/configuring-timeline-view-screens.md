# Configuring Timeline View for AEM Screens {#configuring-timelineview-screens}

## Introduction {#introduction}

This section describes how to create a Timeline View for AEM Screens. 

AEM provides a suite of features that allow multiple people in groups in an organization to collaborate on channel creation, management, and use.
The timeline, located in the left bar, describes the channels, location, or any screen folder's life cycle in time order conveying what has happened to it over its life. This can be filtered down by type.
The timeline rail provides the below features in addition to the life cycle logs.
