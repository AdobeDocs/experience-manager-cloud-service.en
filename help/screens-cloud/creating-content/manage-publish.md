# Publishing Channels in Screens as a Cloud Service {#publish-channel-screens-cloud}

## Introduction {#introduction}

You can publish content from AEM Screens. The Manage Publication feature allows you to deliver content updates from author to publish to player. You can publish or un-publish content for your entire AEM Screens project or only for one of your channels, location, player, or an application.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Once you create you channel or channels in your project, it is mandatory to publish the channels in order to display the channel/channel(s) in inventory list view in AEM Screens Services Provider.

## Objective {#objective}
