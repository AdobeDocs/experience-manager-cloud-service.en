# Creating and Managing Players in Screens as a Cloud Service {#creating-players-screens-cloud}

Once you have published the channels from your AEM Screens Project, you must create players from Screens Services Provider. 

A *Player* runs the player software to produce a visual output. It is able to control displaying a cropped, scaled, translated portion of common content or experience. The screen configuration is bound to a display but can be replaced in case a technical defect occurs.
