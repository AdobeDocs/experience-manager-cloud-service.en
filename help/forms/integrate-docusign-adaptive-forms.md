# Using DocuSign with an adaptive form {#integrate-aem-forms-with-DocuSign}

DocuSign is a prominent e-signature solution. You can use it to e-sign an agreement. You can integrate DocuSign with an adaptive form. It helps you send an adaptive form for e-signatures to multiple recipients. Using e-signatures helps you:

- Close deals from any device with fully automated proposal, quote, and contract processes.
- Finish Human Resource processes faster and give your employees the digital experiences.
- Cut contract cycle times and onboard your vendors faster.

AEM Forms as a Cloud Service provides a [custom submit action for DocuSign](#deploy-custom-submit-action). The submit action helps you to send the adaptive forms for e-signatures using DocuSign APIs.

| You can also use Adobe's e-signature solution, Adobe Sign, to e-sign an adaptive form. AEM Forms has a much deeper integration with Adobe Sign and provides much finer controls like sequential and parallel signing, multiple authentication methods, in-form signing experience and more. For more information, see [Using Adobe Sign in an Adaptive Form](working-with-adobe-sign.md). |

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The following are required to integrate DocuSign with AEM Forms:

- A DocuSign [developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/account/)
- A DocuSign application
- Credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) of DocuSign API application.
- [Custom submit action and Cloud service for DocuSign](https://github.com/adobe/aem-forms-docusign-sample)
- (For local development environment only) [Setup Document of Record](setup-local-development-environment.md#docker-microservices).

## Configure custom submit action and Cloud service for DocuSign {#deploy-custom-submit-action}

AEM Forms as a Cloud Service provides a custom submit action for DocuSign. The submit action helps you to send the adaptive forms for e-signatures using DocuSign APIs. Code for custom submit action is available on [AEM Forms samples public git repository](https://github.com/adobe/aem-forms-docusign-sample). You can deploy the code as it is on your AEM Forms environment or customize it as per the requirements of your organization.

Perform the following steps to configure out-of-the-box custom submit action and DocuSign Cloud Service:

1. [Clone your AEM Forms as a Cloud Service project](setup-local-development-environment.md#forms-cloud-service-local-development-environment) or create an [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] project based on [AEM Archetype 27](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype) or later. To create an [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] project based on AEM Archetype:
   </br> Open the command prompt and run the below command to create an [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a Cloud Service project:

   ```shell
   mvn -B archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.adobe.aem -DarchetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=27 -DaemVersion="cloud" -DappTitle="My Site" -DappId="mysite" -DgroupId="com.mysite" -DincludeForms="y"
   ```

   Also, change `appTitle`, `appId`, and `groupId`, in the above command to reflect your environment.

1. Clone the [aem-forms-samples](https://github.com/adobe/aem-forms-docusign-sample) repository. This repository contains custom submit action for DocuSign and configuration details to connect with the DocuSign server.

1. Open the AEM Forms as a Cloud Service project created in Step 1 for editing in IDE of your choice.

1. Open the `[AEM Forms as a Cloud Service project]\pom.xml` file for editing and make the following changes:

   1. Add the following text at the end of the `<properties>` tag:

      ```shell
      <repository.location>maven_repository</repository.location>
      ```

   1. Add the following text at the end of the `<repositories>` tag:

      ```shell
       <repository>
          <id>project-repository</id>
          <url>file://${project.basedir}/${repository.location}</url>
       </repository>
      ```

      If there is no `<repositories>` tag, create the tag below the `<properties>` tag.

   1. Add the following text at the end of the `<dependencyManagement>` tag:

      ```shell
       <dependency>
         <groupId>com.adobe.aemforms.samples</groupId>
         <artifactId>forms.integration.docusign.all</artifactId>
         <type>zip</type>
         <version>1.0.0</version>
       </dependency>
      ```

1. Perform the following steps in the `all/pom.xml` file available in Cloud Service project folder:

   1. Add the following text at the end of the `<embeddeds>` tag:

      ```shell
       <embedded>
          <groupId>com.adobe.aemforms.samples</groupId>
          <artifactId>forms.integration.docusign.all</artifactId>
          <type>zip</type>
          <target>/apps/moonlightprodprogram-vendor-packages/application/install</target>
       </embedded>
      ```

   1. Add the following text at the end of the `<dependencies>` tag:

      ```shell
       <dependency>
          <groupId>com.adobe.aemforms.samples</groupId>
          <artifactId>forms.integration.docusign.all</artifactId>
          <type>zip</type>
       </dependency>
      ```

1. Open the command prompt and navigate to `aem-forms-samples\forms-integration-docusign` (cloned in step 3) and run the following command:

   ```shell
   mvn clean install -Dinstall.dir="<AEM Forms as a Cloud Service project path>/maven_repository"
   ```

   `<AEM Forms as a Cloud Service project path>` refers to the name of the folder created in step 1 of this procedure.

1. Deploy the project to your local development environment. You can use the following command to deploy to your local development environment

   `mvn -PautoInstallPackage clean install`

   After executing these steps, you can view a new custom submit action [Submit with DocuSign electronic signatures](#enabledocusign) available in the list of submission options for an adaptive form and a [DocuSign cloud service configuration](#configure-docusign-with-aem-forms) in your local development environment.

1. Compile and [Deploy the code to your [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service environment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/deploying/overview.html?lang=en#customer-releases).
