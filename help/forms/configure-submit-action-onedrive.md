# Submit an Adaptive Form to Microsoft速 OneDrive 

The **[!UICONTROL Submit to OneDrive]** Submit Action connects an Adaptive Form with a Microsoft&reg; OneDrive. You can submit the form data, files, attachments, or Document of Record to the connected Microsoft&reg; OneDrive Storage. 

AEM as a Cloud Service offers various out of the box submit actions for handling form submissions. You can learn more about these options in the [Adaptive Form Submit Action](/help/forms/configure-submit-actions-core-components.md)  article.

## Advantages

Some of the advantages of seamless integration of AEM Forms and Microsoft速 OneDrive are:

* Cross-device accessibility of OneDrive ensures that stored form data is readily available on different platforms. Users can access the submitted data, attachments, and documents from desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices, enhancing accessibility and flexibility.
