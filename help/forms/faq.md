You can use custom functions with Visual Editor to continue obtaining the results obtained with Code Editor.

Caching secured content features is disabled, by default. To enable the feature, you can perform the instructions provided at [Caching Secured Content](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/configuring/permissions-cache.html).

* **I have a localized Adaptive Form; it is not rendering localized version? What could be the cause and how to resolve it?**

  URL convention of localized Adaptive Forms now supports specifying a locale in the URL. New URL convention enables caching localized forms on a Dispatcher or CDN. On Cloud Service environment, use the URL format `http://host:port/content/forms/af/<afName>.<locale>.html` to request a localized version of an Adaptive Form instead of `http://host:port/content/forms/af/afName.html?afAcceptLang=<locale>`. Adobe recommends using Dispatcher or CDN caching. It helps improve rendering speed of prefilled forms.

By default, CDN refreshes cache after every 5 minutes, wait for 5 minutes, and then check for the updated version.

* **Can I use the Signature step in an Adaptive Form to create an in-browser signing experience?**
No, the Signature step is not available for [!DNL Forms] as a Cloud Service. Remove the Signature step in your Adaptive Forms. Instead of Signature step, allow the users to Sign an Adaptive Form after submission. It helps you continue providing an in-browser signing experience.

* **Can I use the Verify step in an Adaptive Form?**
No, the Verify step is not available for [!DNL Forms] as a Cloud Service. Remove the verify step from your existing Adaptive Forms before moving such forms to a Cloud Service environment.

* **Can I add charts to an Adaptive Form?**
Yes, you can add charts to Adaptive Forms. Adaptive Forms provides a chart component. You can use it to add charts to an Adaptive Form.

* **Can I use custom certificates with Form Data Model for authentication?**
Form Data Model does not provide a method to use custom certificates for authentication. So, the custom certificates like x509 and 2-way SSL are not supported.  

* **Can I use Forms Portal submit action Adaptive Forms?** 

  You can modify your existing Adaptive Forms to use [Submit to REST endpoint](configuring-submit-actions.md#submit-to-rest-endpoint), [Send email](configuring-submit-actions.md#send-email), [Submit using Form Data Model](configuring-submit-actions.md#submit-using-form-data-model), and [Invoke an AEM Workflow](configuring-submit-actions.md#invoke-an-aem-workflow) Submit actions. Forms Portal and Forms Portal submit action are not available yet. Keep an eye on monthly release notes for the availability of the features.

* **Can I use [!DNL AEM Forms] app with [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service?**
