# Configure the Send Email submit action for an Adaptive Form

The **[!UICONTROL Send Email]** Submit Action enables you to send an email to one or more recipients upon successful submission of the form. This Submit Action enables you to create an email that can include form data in a predefined format. For instance, consider the following template where customer name, shipping address, state name, and ZIP code are retrieved from the submitted form data:


     ```
     Hi ${customer_Name},
 
     The following is set as your deafult shipping address:
     ${customer_Name},
     ${customer_Shipping_Address},
     ${customer_State},
     ${customer_ZIPCode}
 
     Regards,
     WKND 
 
     ```

## Best Practices {#best-practices}

* It is recommended to keep the email content clear and concise. Users should understand the purpose of the email and any actions they need to take.
* It is recommended for all form fields to have unique element names, even if they are placed on different panels within an Adaptive Form.
* When using AEM as a Cloud Service, outbound email requires encryption. By default, outbound email functionality is disabled.
