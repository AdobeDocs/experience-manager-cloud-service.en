Enable your developers to create, publish, and manage interactive forms that can be accessed and interacted with through APIs, rather than through a traditional graphical user interface. <br/> <br/> These forms are designed to be submitted without the need for a traditional HTML form interface. In other words, they allow you to submit form data programmatically via an API or backend code without requiring any visible form elements on the front-end. <br/> <br/> Headless forms are useful in various scenarios, such as when building single-page applications, progressive web apps, or mobile applications, where a traditional HTML form interface may not be necessary or practical. By allowing developers to submit form data directly through APIs or backend code, headless forms help streamline workflows and improve the overall performance of web applications.|
