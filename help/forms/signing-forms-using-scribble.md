# Apply electronic signatures to a form using scribble signatures{#apply-electronic-signatures-to-a-form-using-deprecated-scribble-signatures}

You can use the **Scribble Signature** component and **Signature Step** component to draw (Scribble) signature on an Adaptive Form. The Signature step component displays a PDF version of the Adaptive Form. You require a Document of Record option enabled or form template based Adaptive Forms to use the Signature step component.

## Various Options available in Signature Window

* **A:** Click the **Paint Brush** icon to draw your signature on canvas.
* **B:** Click the **Clear** icon to clear the signature on canvas.
* **C:** Click the **Geolocation** icon to add geolocation along with the signature.
* **D:** Click the **Keyboard** icon to type your name on canvas. 

 Once you tap the Done ![aem_forms_save](assets/aem_forms_save.png) icon in Scribble signature window, you cannot edit the signature. In case, if you want to edit the signature, you have to disregard the current signature and re-sign using the above Paint Brush/Keyboard option.

You can tap the **Configure** ![](assets/configure.png) icon to set the aspect ratio of Scribble Signature canvas. 
* When the aspect ratio of the Scribble Signature canvas is less than 1, the geolocation information is added at the bottom of the Scribble Signature canvas.


* When the aspect ratio of the Scribble Signature canvas is more than 1, the geolocation information is added to the right-side of the Scribble Signature canvas.
