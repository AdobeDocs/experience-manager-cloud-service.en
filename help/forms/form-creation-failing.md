# Issue {#form-creation-fails}

After updating to AEM Forms as a Cloud Service version `2024.5.16461.20240524T172309Z`, When a user publishes a form using an unpublished template, it fails to create a form and shows an error:

`Property is protected: jcr:uuid = 09e0d6be-f619-4405-b021-27eb1c5326d3`

## Solution {#troubleshoot-form-creation-fails}

To resolve the issue, perform the following workaround steps:

1. Publish the template explicitly using the template console.
    
    >[!NOTE]
    > Prior to this step ensure that the (unpublished) template does not have `jcr:uuid` and other system generated properties under the initial content's `jcr:content node`. To sort out it, first, sanitize the template to publish it explicitly.

    >[!NOTE]
    > This action doesn't replicate the initial content node.
1. Now, when your template is published, try creating new forms using the template.
1. If the template is changed in the future, publish it again as mentioned in the step 1.
