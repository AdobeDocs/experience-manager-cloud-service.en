[!DNL Adobe Acrobat Sign] enables e-signature workflows for Adaptive Forms and AEM Workflows. E-signatures improve workflows to process documents for legal, sales, payroll, human resource management, and many more areas.

In a typical [!DNL Adobe Acrobat Sign] and Adaptive Forms scenario, a user fills an Adaptive Form to apply for a service. For example, a credit card application and a citizen benefits form. When a user fills, submits, and signs the application form, the form is sent to the service provider for further action. Service provider reviews the application and uses [!DNL Adobe Acrobat Sign] to mark the application approved. AEM Forms supports both Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Acrobat Sign Solutions for Government. Depending on your license and requirements, you can integrate or connect AEM Forms with either of the solution:

* [Connect AEM Forms with Adobe Acrobat Sign](#adobe-sign)
* [Connect AEM Forms with Adobe Acrobat Sign Solutions for Government](#adobe-acrobat-sign-for-government)

## Configure [!DNL Adobe Acrobat Sign] scheduler to sync the signing status {#configure-adobe-sign-scheduler-to-sync-the-signing-status}

AEM Forms as a Cloud Service, provides a scheduler service that checks the status of signers at defined intervals. The scenarios in which you configure the scheduler service: 

* If you use [Submit the form (after every recipient completes signing ceremony)](/help/forms/working-with-adobe-sign.md#select-adobe-sign-cloud-service-and-signing-order) to sign a document, the form is submitted only after all signers have signed the form.
* If you use the [Sign Step in an AEM Workflow](/help/forms/aem-forms-workflow-step-reference.md#sign-document-step) to sign a document, the sign step waits for all the signers to sign the document, before proceeding to the next step of the workflow.

By default, the [!DNL Adobe Acrobat Sign] Scheduler services checks (polls) signer response after every 24 hours. You can change the default interval for your environment.

To change the default interval, specify a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression) for the **sign.status.exp** property of the **Adobe Acrobat Sign Configuration Service** configuration.

For example, to run the configuration service daily at 00:00 am, set the **sign.status.exp** property of the **Adobe Acrobat Sign Configuration Service** configuration to specify `0 0 0 1/1 * ? *`. The following JSON file displays the sample to run the configuration service daily at 00:00 am:

```json
{
  "sign.status.exp":"0 0 0 1/1 * ? *"
}
```

To set values of a configuration, [Generate OSGi Configurations using the AEM SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/deploying/configuring-osgi.html?lang=en#generating-osgi-configurations-using-the-aem-sdk-quickstart), and [deploy the configuration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/using-cloud-manager/deploy-code.html?lang=en#deployment-process) to your Cloud Service instance.
