# HTML Components supported in Form Block Edge Delivery

AEM Forms Edge Delivery includes a Form block. The Form Block helps you to easily create forms to capture and store captured data. 

The Form block supports OOTB HTML-5 components such as text, email, number, date, and many more. It also supports text area, select, and fieldset elements, and includes input validation features that are native to HTML-5. The Form Block creates uniform HTML structure for all field types and containers ensuring the consistency. You also [style the field types](https://adobe-rnd.github.io/form-block/customization/styling_form) using the `form.css` file. 

## Supported HTML 5 input types in Form Block

The Form Block supports a range of HTML 5 input types, and it also seamlessly renders forms created with AEM core components.

Here is the table which outlines how core components correspond to their HTML-5 input types in Edge Delivery:
