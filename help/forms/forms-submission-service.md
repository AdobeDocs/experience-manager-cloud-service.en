## Advantages to use Forms Submission service

A few advantages of using the Forms Submission Service with spreadsheets are:

* **Direct integration**: You can configure forms to submit data directly to a specified spreadsheet, eliminating the need for manual data transfer. 
* **Data structure**: When setting up the submission, you can map form fields to corresponding spreadsheet columns for organized data storage. 
* **Access control**: You can leverage existing permissions to control who can access and modify submitted form data, depending on the chosen spreadsheet service. 

## Pre-requisites

Below are the prerequisites for using the Forms Submission service:

* Make sure your AEM Project has the latest Adaptive Form Block.  
* Ensure you have an AEM Forms add-on license.
* Ensure that your Git repository is added to the allowlist to use the Forms Submission Service. Fill out the [form](https://main--afb--adobe.hlx.page/docs/docbased/submit#feature-enablement-request) to request for Forms Submission Service.  
* Ensure that your spreadsheet has edit access granted to the `forms@adobe.com` account.  
  
## Configure Forms Submission service 

Create new AEM project configured with the Adaptive Forms Block. Refer to the [Getting Started - Developer Tutorial]([/help/forms/](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/build-forms/getting-started-edge-delivery-services-forms/tutorial)) article to learn how to create a new AEM project. Update the `fstab.yaml` file in your project. Replace the existing reference with the path to the folder you have shared with the `forms@adobe.com` .

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can refer to the [spreadsheet](/help/forms/assets/spreadsheet.xlsx) to use the Forms Submission service.

### Configuring the Forms Submission Service using API

You can also send a **POST** request to the form to update the `incoming` sheet with data. 

>[!NOTE] 
>
> * If the `incoming` sheet does not exist, AEM would not send any data to this workbook.
> * Share the `incoming` sheet with the Adobe Experience Manager the `forms@adobe.com` and grant the edit access.
> * Preview and publish the `incoming` sheet in the sidekick.

To understand how to format the POST request for setting up your sheet, refer to the [API documentation](https://main--afb--adobe.hlx.page/docs/index.html#/paths/~1%7Bid%7D/post). You can look at the example provided below: 

You can use tools like curl or Postman to execute this POST request, as demonstrated below.

* **Using Postman**:
    
For example, send the request below in Postman after replacing:
  * `{id}` with your Form ID
  * `site or repository` with your GitHub repository or site name
  * `organization` with your GitHub username
   
    ```json

    POST 'https://forms.adobe.com/adobe/forms/af/submit/{id}' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-adobe-routing: tier=live,bucket=main--[site/repository]--[organization]' \
    --data '{
        "data": {
            "startDate": "2025-01-10",
            "endDate": "2025-01-25",
            "destination": "Australia",
            "class": "First Class",
            "budget": "2000",
            "amount": "1000000",
            "name": "Mary",
            "age": "35",
            "subscribe": null,
            "email": "mary@gmail.com"
                }
            }'
     ```

Clicking the **Send** button in Postman returns a `201 Created` response, and the `incoming` sheet updates with the submitted data.

* **Using Curl command**:

For example, execute the below commmand in terminal or command prompt after replacing:
* `{id}` with your Form ID
* `site or repository` with your GitHub repository or site name
* `organization` with your GitHub username

            }'

        ```
