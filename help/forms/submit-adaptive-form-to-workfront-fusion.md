# Submit an Adaptive Form to Adobe Workfront Fusion

<span class="preview"> The feature is available under early adopter program. You can write to aem-forms-early-adopter-program@adobe.com from your official email id to join the early adopter program and request access to the capability. </span>

[Adobe Workfront Fusion](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/adobe-workfront-fusion/get-started-with-workfront-fusion/workfront-fusion-overview.html) automates the process of repeating the same tasks, like document approval workflows, email filtering and sorting, allowing you to focus on new tasks instead of recurring ones. Adobe Workfront Fusion includes multiple scenarios. A scenario consists of series of modules which executes data transfer between applications and web services. In a scenario, you add various steps (modules) to automate a task. 

For example, using Workfront Fusion, you can create a scenario to gather data with Adaptive Form, process the data, and send the data to a data store for archival. Once a scenario is set up, Workfront Fusion automatically executes the tasks whenever a user fills out a form, updating the data store seamlessly.

AEM as a Cloud Service offers various out of the box submit actions for handling form submissions. You can learn more about these options in the [Adaptive Form Submit Action](/help/forms/configure-submit-actions-core-components.md)  article.


## Advantages of using Adobe Workfront Fusion{#advatages-of-workfront-fusion}

Some of the advantages of using Adobe Workfront Fusion with AEM Forms:

* Sending data captured with Adaptive Forms to a Workfront Fusion scenario
* Automating tasks which are less prone to errors.
* Customizing requirements specific to an organization that are not directly included in Workfront.
* Handling simple logics and straightforward decisions, for example, if/then statements.

## Prerequisites to integrate AEM Forms with Adobe Workfront Fusion {#prerequisites}

Prerequisites required to connect Workfront Fusion to AEM Forms are:

* A valid [Workfront Fusion license](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/adobe-workfront-fusion/get-started-with-workfront-fusion/license-automation-vs-integration.html).
* An AEM user with right to access [Dev Console](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) to [retrieve the service credentials](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/authentication/service-credentials.html).

## Integrate AEM Forms with Adobe Workfront Fusion

To connect [Workfront fusion](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/adobe-workfront-fusion/get-started-with-workfront-fusion/workfront-fusion-overview.html) to a form, perform the following steps:

### 1. Create a Workfront Scenario {#workflow-scenario}

To create a Workfront scenario:
1. Sign into your [Workfront Fusion account](https://app-qa.workfrontfusion.com/).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Scenarios]** ![Share icon](/help/forms/assets/Smock_ShareAndroid_18_N.svg) in the left panel. 
 1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create a new scenario]** in the upper-right corner of the page. A page to create new scenario appears on-screen.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL New scenario]** in the upper-left corner on the page and type a proper name for the scenario.
1. Click the question mark and make sure you add first module as **[!UICONTROL AEM Forms]**.

      ![Add a AEM Forms module](/help/forms/assets/workfront-aemforms.png)

    The **[!UICONTROL Watch for Form Events]** dialog box appears.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > It is mandatory to add first module as **[!UICONTROL AEM Forms]**.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Watch for Form Events]** dialog box and a window to add a webhook appears.

#### 1.1 Add a webhook {#add-webhook}

![Add a webhook](/help/forms/assets/workfront-add-webhook.png)

To add a webhook:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** and a **[!UICONTROL Add a webhook]** dialog box appears.
1. Specify a webhook name.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > It is recommended to choose your webhook name carefully, as the specified webhook name appears in the AEM instance. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** to add new connection. The **[!UICONTROL Create a Connection]** dialog box appears.

#### 1.2 Add a connection to a webhook {#add-connection}

![Add a connection](/help/forms/assets/workfront-add-connection.png)

To add a connection:

1. Specify a **[!UICONTROL Connection Name]** in the **[!UICONTROL Create a Connection]** dialog box.

1. Select **Environment** and **Type** from the drop-down list.

1. Enter the **Instance URL**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Instance URL is the unique web address which points to a specific AEM Forms instance.

    You can retrieve the [service credentials from the Developer console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/authentication/service-credentials.html) required to create a connection.

1. Replace `ims-na1.adobelogin.com` in the **IMS endpoint** with the value of **imsEndpoint** from the service credentials in the Developer console.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Retain the `https://` in the **IMS endpoint** textbox while adding the `imsEndpoint` URL. 

1. Specify the following values in the **[!UICONTROL Create a Connection]** dialog box:
    * Specify **Client ID** with value of **clientId** from the service credentials in the Developer console.
    * Specify **Client Secret** with value of **clientSecret** from the service credentials in the Developer console.
    * Specify **Technical Account ID**  with value of **id** from the service credentials in the Developer console.
    * Specify **Org ID**  with value of **org** from the service credentials in the Developer console.
    * **Meta Scopes**  with value of **metascopes** from the service credentials in the Developer console.
    * **Private Keys**  with value of **privateKey** from the service credentials in the Developer console.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >* For **Private Key**, remove `\r\n` from its value. 
    >  For example, if the private key value is:
    >`\r\nIJAVO8GDYAOZ9jMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMDAxL\r\nMy1lMTUxODMxLWNtc3RnLWludGVncmF0aW9uLTAw`, then after removing the `\r\n` from the private key, the key would look like the following, with both the values appearing in a separate line: 
    >
    >   `IJAVO8GDYAOZ9jMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMDAxL`
    >
    >   `My1lMTUxODMxLWNtc3RnLWludGVncmF0aW9uLTAw`
    > 
    >* You also have the option to retrieve a private key or certificate from the file by selecting the **Extract** button.

1. Click **Continue**.

    The created connection starts appearing in the drop-down list of the **[!UICONTROL Connection]** in the **[!UICONTROL Add a webhook]** dialog box.

1. Select the created connection **[!UICONTROL Connection]** from the drop-down list.

## Best Practices {#best-practices}

* It is recommended to choose your webhook name carefully, as there is no way to get the scenario name at the AEM instance. In case, you change the webhook name in future it is not reflected at the AEM Forms submit action drop-down list.
* A scenario can have multiple webhook links but at a time only one webhook link is active. It is recommended to delete the unlinked webhook, so that it does not appear in AEM Forms submit action drop-down list.

<!-- During testing or development of Workfront, add the Author URL to the instance URL. However, when deploying Workfront Fusion in a production environment, it is recommended to replicate the scenario URLs for the Publish instance. -->
