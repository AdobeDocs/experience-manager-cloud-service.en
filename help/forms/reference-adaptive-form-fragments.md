# Reference Adaptive Form Fragments {#reference-adaptive-form-fragments}

Adaptive Form Fragment is a group of fields, or a panel containing a group of fields that you can use when you create a form. It lets you create a form easily and quickly. You can drag-drop an Adaptive Form Fragment into a form using the assets browser in sidebar, and you can edit it in the form editor.

For Adaptive Forms authors, reference fragments are provided in the [!DNL AEM Forms] package [[!DNL AEM FORMS] REFERENCE FRAGMENTS](https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/marketplace/marketplaceProxy.html?packagePath=/content/companies/public/adobe/packages/cq630/fd/AEM-FORMS-6.3-REFERENCE-FRAGMENTS). It includes the following fragments:

* Address
* Contact Information
* Credit card Information  
* Current Employment
* Dependents Information  
* Employment History
* Income & Expenditure
* Name  
* Terms & Conditions
* Terms & Conditions with Scribble

When you install the package, a Reference Fragments folder containing reference fragments is created under Forms & Documents.
