# Integrate Turnstile CAPTCHA with Adaptive Forms

<span class="preview"> This feature is under Early Adopter Program. You can write to aem-forms-ea@adobe.com from your official email id to join the early adopter program and request access to the capability. </span>

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a program commonly used in online transactions to distinguish between humans and automated programs or bots. It poses a challenge and evaluates user response to determine if it's a human or a bot interacting with the site. It prevents the user to proceed if the test fails and helps make online transactions secure by keeping bots from posting spam or malicious purposes. 

AEM Forms as a Cloud Service supports the following CAPTCHA solutions: 

* [Cloudflare Turnstile](#integrate-aem-forms-environment-with-turnstile-captcha)
* [Google reCAPTCHA](/help/forms/captcha-adaptive-forms.md)
* [hCaptcha](/help/forms/integrate-adaptive-forms-hcaptcha.md) 

## Integrate AEM Forms environment with Turnstile Captcha

Cloudflare's Turnstile Captcha is a security measure that aims to protect forms and sites from automated bots, malicious attacks, spams and unwanted automated traffic. It presents a checkbox on form submission to verify that they are human, before allowing them to submit the form. AEM Forms as a Cloud Service supports Turnstile Captcha in Adaptive Forms Core Components.

### Prerequisites to integrate AEM Forms environment with Turnstile Captcha {#prerequisite}

To configure Turnstile for AEM Forms Core Components, you need to obtain the [Turnstile sitekey and secret key](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/) from the Turnstile website.

### Steps to configure Turnstile for AEM Forms{#steps-to-configure-turnstile}

1. Create a Configuration Container on your AEM Forms as a Cloud Service environment. A Configuration Container holds Cloud Configurations used to connect AEM to external services. To create and configure a Configuration Container to connect your AEM Forms environment with Turnstile:
    1. Open your AEM Forms as a Cloud Service instance. 
    1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Tools > General > Configuration Browser]**.  
    1. In the Configuration Browser, you can select an existing folder or create a folder. You can create a folder and enable the Cloud Configurations option for it or enable the Cloud Configurations option for an existing folder:

        * **To create a folder and enable the Cloud Configurations option for it**:
            1. In the Configuration Browser, click **[!UICONTROL Create]**. 
            1. In the Create Configuration dialog, specify a name, title, and select the **[!UICONTROL Cloud Configurations]** option. 
            1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.
        * To enable the Cloud Configurations option for an existing folder:
            1. In the Configuration Browser, select the folder and select **[!UICONTROL Properties]**.
            1. In the Configuration Properties dialog, enable **[!UICONTROL Cloud Configurations]**.
            1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save & Close]** to save the configuration and exit the dialog. 

1. Configure the Cloud Service: 
    1. On your AEM author instance, go to ![tools-1](assets/tools-1.png) &gt; **[!UICONTROL Cloud Services]** and select **[!UICONTROL Turnstile]**.
        ![Turnstile in ui](assets/turnstile-in-ui.png)
    1. Select a Configuration Container, created or updated, as described in the previous section. Select **[!UICONTROL Create]**.
        ![Configuration Turnstile](assets/config-hcaptcha.png)
    1. Specify **[!UICONTROL Widget Type]** as managed, widget type can change which depends on the key obtained in the prerequisite, **[!UICONTROL Title]**, **[!UICONTROL Name]**, **[!UICONTROL Site Key]**, and **[!UICONTROL Secret Key]** for Turnstile service [obtained in prerequisite](#prerequisite). Select **[!UICONTROL Create]**.

  >[!NOTE]
  > Users need not to modify Client-side JavaScript validation URL and Server-side validation URL as they are already prefilled for Turnstile validation.

Once the Turnstile Captcha service is configured, it is available for use in an Adaptive Form.

## Use Turnstile in an Adaptive Form{#using-turnstile-foundation-components}

1. Open your AEM Forms as a Cloud Service instance. 
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Forms]** > **[!UICONTROL Forms and Documents]**.
1. Select an Adaptive Form and select **[!UICONTROL Properties]**. For the **[!UICONTROL Configuration Container]** option, select the Configuration Container that contains the Cloud Configuration that connects AEM Forms with Turnstile, and select **[!UICONTROL Save & Close]**.

    If you do not have such a Configuration Container, see section [Connect your AEM Forms environment with Turnstile](#connect-your-forms-environment-with-turnstile-service) to learn how to create a Configuration Container.

    ![Select Configuration Container](/help/forms/assets/captcha-properties.png)

1. Select an Adaptive Form and select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**. The Adaptive Form opens in Adaptive Forms Editor. 
1. From the component browser, drag-drop the **[!UICONTROL Captcha]** component onto the Adaptive Form.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Captcha]** component and click on properties ![Properties icon](assets/configure-icon.svg) icon. It opens the properties dialog.

    Specify the following properties:

    * **[!UICONTROL Title]:** Specify the title for your Captcha component, you can identify a form component easily with its unique name both in the form and in the rule editor.
    * **[!UICONTROL Validation Message]:** Provide a validation message for validating Captcha on form submission.
    * **[!UICONTROL Validate Captcha]:** You can select one of the options, to validate Captcha: 
        * At form Submission 
        * On a user action.
    * **[!UICONTROL Captcha Service]:** Select your Captcha service, here you select Cloudfare Turnstile Captcha service.
    * **[!UICONTROL Captcha Configuration]:** Select a Cloud Configuration configured for Turnstile. for example, here you select the **managed key**.
        >[!NOTE]
        >You can have multiple Cloud Configurations in your environment for a similar purpose. So, choose the service carefully. If no service is listed, see [Connect your AEM Forms environment with Turnstile](#connect-your-forms-environment-with-turnstile-service) to learn how to create a Cloud Service that connects your AEM Forms environment with Turnstile service.

    * **Error Message:** Provide the error message to display to the user when the Captcha submission fails.
    * **Captcha Size:** You select the display size of the Turnstile challenge dialog. Use the **[!UICONTROL Compact]** option to display a small sized and the **[!UICONTROL Normal]** option to display a relatively large-size Turnstile challenge dialog.


        >[!NOTE]
        >This is applicable for widget type Managed and Non-interactive. If the widget type is invisible, the size property is not required and it is disabled.
        
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Done]**.

Now, only legitimate forms, in which the form filler successfully clears the challenge posed by the Turnstile service are allowed for the form submission.
