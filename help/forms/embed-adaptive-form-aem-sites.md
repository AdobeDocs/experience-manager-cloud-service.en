<span class="preview"> Adobe recommends using the modern and extensible data capture [Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/introduction.html) for [creating new Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/creating-adaptive-form-core-components.md) or [adding Adaptive Forms to AEM Sites pages](/help/forms/create-or-add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page.md). These components represent a significant advancement in Adaptive Forms creation, ensuring impressive user experiences. This article describes older approach to author Adaptive Forms using foundation components. </span>


AEM Forms allow form developers to seamlessly embed Adaptive Forms in an AEM Sites page or a web page hosted outside AEM. The embedded Adaptive Form is fully functional and users can fill and submit the form without leaving the page. It helps user remain in context of other elements on the web page and simultaneously interact with the form. This allows your users to conveniently fill and submit forms without ever leaving the page they are on. This integration provides a convenient way to reuse Adaptive Forms they have already created. 

You can use AEM Page Editor to quickly embed multiple forms to your AEM Sites pages. Using AEM Page Editor allows content authors to create seamless data capture experiences within a Sites page using the power of Adaptive Forms components including dynamic behavior, validations, data integration, generate document of record and business process automation. It also allows you to use various features of AEM Sites pages like, versioning, targeting, translation, and multi-site manager.

AEM Forms provide **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Container]** and **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms – Embed(v2)]** components. You can use **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms – Embed(v2)]** component to add an existing Adaptive Form or create a new form using Adaptive Forms Editor , while **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Container]** to create a new form within an Experience Fragment or AEM Sites page.

## Why embed an Adaptive Form in AEM Sites page or AEM Experience Fragment? 

Using **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms – Embed(v2)]** in AEM Page Editor allows you to create seamless data capture experiences within a Sites page using the power of Adaptive Forms components including dynamic behavior, validations, data integration, generate document of record and business process automation. It also allows you to use various features of AEM Sites pages like, versioning, targeting, translation, and multi-site manager, enhancing the overall form creation and management experience. Let's explore some of these features:

* **Versioning:** AEM Sites pages offer [robust versioning capabilities](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/features/page-versions.md), allowing you to track and manage different versions of your forms. This enables you to make changes and enhancements to forms while maintaining the ability to roll back to previous versions if needed. Versioning ensures a controlled and organized approach to form development and evolution.
* **Targeting (Integration with Adobe Target):** With AEM Sites pages targeting capabilities, you can also [personalize the form experience for different audiences](/help/sites-cloud/integrating/integration-adobe-target-ims.md). By leveraging user segments and targeting criteria, you can tailor the form's content, design, or behavior to specific groups of users. This enables you to provide a personalized and relevant form experience, increasing engagement and conversion rates.
* **Translation:** AEM Sites [seamless integration with translation services](/help/sites-cloud/administering/translation/overview.md), allowing you to translate forms into multiple languages easily. This feature simplifies the localization process, ensuring that your forms are accessible to a global audience. You can manage translations efficiently within AEM translation projects, reducing time and effort required for multilingual form support. See considerations section for more information on translation.  
* **Multi-site Management and Live Copy:** AEM Sites provide robust [Multi-site Management and Live Copy capabilities](/help/sites-cloud/administering/msm/overview.md), enabling you to create and manage multiple websites within a single environment. This feature now allows you to reuse forms across different sites, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication efforts. With centralized control and management, you can efficiently maintain and update forms across multiple websites.
* **Themes:** AEM Sites pages provide a framework for designing and maintaining consistent visual styles across multiple web pages. These define colors, fonts, style sheets, and other visual elements that contribute to the overall look and feel of the website. [You can use the themes designed for an AEM Sites page for an Adaptive Form, saving time and effort](/help/sites-cloud/administering/site-creation/site-themes.md#using-site-themes-using-themes). 
* **Tagging:** AEM Sites pages allow you to [assign tags or labels to a page, an asset, or other content](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/tagging-framework.md). Tags are keywords or metadata labels that provide a way to categorize and organize content based on specific criteria. You can assign one or more tags to pages, assets, or any other content items within AEM to improve search and categorize the assets. 
* **Locking and Unlocking content:** AEM Sites allow users to [control access and modifications to pages](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/editing-content.md) within the AEM Sites environment. When a page is locked, it means that it is protected from unauthorized changes or edits by other users. Only the user who has locked the content or a designated administrator can unlock it to allow modifications. 

In addition, Adaptive Forms in AEM Page Editor use [Adaptive Forms Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/introduction.html?lang=en#features). These Core Components provide a standard and easier methods to style and customize the components, identical to [AEM Sites WCM Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/introduction.html?lang=en).

## How to create or embed an Adaptive Form in AEM Sites page or in AEM Experience Fragment? {#various-options-to-create-or-embed-an-adaptive-form-in-aem-sites-page-or-aem-experience-fragment}

You can take full advantage of this feature by utilizing the following options:

* **[Create an Adaptive Form using approved templates and embed it to an AEM Sites page](#embed-form-using-adaptive-form-wizzard-aem-sites):** You can leverage pre-approved templates to quickly create and embed Adaptive Forms that align with your organization's branding guidelines and design standards.  

* **[Embed existing forms to an AEM Sites page](#embed-an-adaptive-form-in-sites-editor):** You can easily integrate forms that you have already created into your websites, enabling visitors to interact with them directly.  

* **[Convert an embeded Adaptive Form to Experience Fragment](#convert-an-adaptive-form-in-sites-page-to-an-experience-fragment):** Convert an embedded Adaptive Form added to an AEM Sites page to an Experience Fragment for reusing the form across multiple AEM Sites pages.

* **[Create and add a custom Adaptive Form to an AEM Sites page](/help/forms/create-or-add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page.md#create-an-adaptive-form-in-sites-editor-or-experience-fragment):** You can use the **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Container]** component to build a brand-new form from scratch, tailoring it specifically to your requirements and design preferences.

* **[Create and add a custom Adaptive Form to an Experience Fragments](/help/forms/create-or-add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page.md#create-an-adaptive-form-in-sites-editor):** You can extend the reach of your forms by adding them to AEM Experience Fragments, allowing for seamless reuse across multiple pages or sites.

* **Add multiple forms to an AEM Sites page or Experience Fragment:**  You can create or add multiple Adaptive Forms to an AEM Sites page to provide multiple choices to users based on their preferences and requirements. You can use AEM Page Editor to quickly embed multiple forms to your AEM Sites pages. You can use the **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Container]** component multiple times to add Adaptive Forms in an AEM Sites page. You can use the **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms - Embed]** component multiple times in an AEM Sites page,only if **[!UICONTROL Form covers entire width of the frame]** option is selected. In case the **[!UICONTROL Form covers entire width of the frame]** option is not checked, AEM Sites page supports only one Adaptive Form to exist without an iframe. In order to add more Adaptive Forms using  the **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms - Embed]** component, you have to select **[!UICONTROL Form covers entire width of the frame]** option. 

## Considerations to embed an Adaptive Form in AEM Sites page or AEM Experience Fragment {#consideration}

* When you create or add a form using the **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms – Embed(v2)]** component, the forms undergo translation and localization using the AEM Forms translation flow. In this case, a single form is maintained and referenced in all the language copies of the Sites pages. **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms – Embed(v2)]** component does not provide access to various features of AEM Sites pages like, versioning, targeting, translation, and multi-site manager.

* When you use the **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Container]** to create a form, the forms undergo translation and localization through the AEM Sites translation flow. For each language, a separate copy (language copy) of the sites page and corresponding forms is generated and when a content author modifies a rule in a form on the parent page, the same changes must be made in all language copies of the form. **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Container]** also allows you to use various features of AEM Sites pages like, versioning, targeting, translation, and multi-site manager.


## Requirements to embed an Adaptive Form in AEM Sites page or AEM Experience Fragment {#before-you-start-embedding-an-adaptive-form}

Before you start embedding a new Adaptive Form or a pre-existing Adaptive Form using **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms – Embed(v2)]**, enable **Adaptive Forms Core Components** and add **Adaptive Forms Client Libraries** to your AEM Sites page:

* **Use Page Language**: Use local of the AEM Sites page instead locale of Adaptive Form. 
* **Set Focus on Form**: Select to set the focus on the first field of the Adaptive Form.
* **Theme**: Select a theme that defines styling for components of your Adaptive Form. Styling includes appearance properties such as font style, background color, dimensions, and alignment.
* **Form covers entire width of the frame**: 
An inline frame (iframe) is an HTML element that loads an Adaptive Form to an AEM Sites page.

    * If the **[!UICONTROL Form covers entire width of the frame]** checkbox is checked, an Adaptive Form occupies the full width of the container in which it is placed. In this case, an iframe is not used to render the form. The layout and design of an Adaptive Form adapt to span the entire width of the container, making it responsive and capable of adjusting to different screen sizes. This option allows to embed multiple Adaptive Forms within an AEM Sites page.
    
        >[!NOTE]
        >
        > To embed multiple forms in an AEM Sites page, select **[!UICONTROL Form covers entire width of the frame]** checkbox. 

    * If the **[!UICONTROL Form covers entire width of the frame]** checkbox is not checked, an Adaptive Form does not cover the entire width of the container. Instead, an iframe is used to render the form, which cannot be extended beyond a specific width. This approach is useful when an Adaptive Form has definite boundaries and needs to coexist with other AEM components next to it within the container. If this option is not checked, it allows only one Adaptive Forms in AEM Sites page to embed without an iframe.

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        > AEM Sites page supports only one Adaptive Form to exist without an iframe. In order to add more Adaptive Forms using  the **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms - Embed]** component, you have to select **[!UICONTROL Form covers entire width of the frame]** option. 

* **Height**: Specify the height of the container. Leave it blank to automatically resize the container.
* **CSS Client library**: Specify path to a CSS client library.

<!--
In AEM Sites page, you can add an Adaptive Form using:

* **Adaptive Forms - Embed component**
   Adaptive Forms - Embed component enables AEM Sites authors to include an existing Adaptive Form within an AEM Sites page, thereby enhancing the reusability of adaptive forms. Existing Adaptive Forms can be used standalone or embedded in the site page. This integration provides a convenient way for customers to reuse Adaptive Forms they have already created.

## Publish embedded Adaptive Form {#publishing-embedded-adaptive-form}

Let's consider the following scenarios for publishing an embedded Adaptive Form in AEM sites page:

* If you are publishing the AEM sites page for the first time and it includes an embedded Adaptive Form, publish the sites page and the embedded asset.
* If you modified only the embedded Adaptive Form  in a published site page, publish the original asset and the changes reflect in the published site page. The published site page includes a reference to the asset and does not require republishing the page.
* If you modified the sites page and the embedded Adaptive Form , republish the sites page and the embedded asset.

## Modify embedded Adaptive Form  {#modifying-embedded-adaptive-form}

To modify any configuration or property of the embedded Adaptive Form, do one of the following.

* Open the original form in an Adaptive Form  in respective editor and modify them.
* Tap the Adaptive Form  from within the site page in edit mode and then tap **[!UICONTROL Edit in a new window]**. The original form opens in edit mode that you can modify.

>The changes made in the original Adaptive Form  automatically reflect in the embedded form. However, republish the Adaptive Form, or the Site's page to reflect the changes in the published page.

## Best practices {#best-practices}

Do keep the following points in mind when embedding Adaptive Forms in AEM sites pages:

* Header and footer in the original form are not included in the embedded form.
* User drafts and submissions of embedded forms are supported and visible in Drafts and Submitted Forms tabs on the Forms Portal.
* The submit action configured on the original form is retained in the embedded form.
* If you have Adobe Analytics configured for the original form, the analytics data of the embedded form is captured in Adobe Analytics. However, it is not available in the forms analytics report.
