### Doc Assurance APIs


AEM Forms Doc Assurance APIs are a set of tools within the AEM Forms Cloud Service Communication APIs that allow you to manage the security and user interaction of your PDF documents.

Here's a breakdown of what Doc Assurance APIs can do:

* **Encrypt and decrypt documents**: Protect your documents by making their contents unreadable with encryption. You have control over what parts of the PDF are encrypted, including the entire document, specific content, metadata, or attachments.

* **Digitally sign documents**: Add digital signatures to your documents for validation and tamper-proof verification. This can be used for certification purposes or to ensure document integrity 

* **Reader Extend your documents (Apply or edit usage rights of PDF documents)**: Enables your organization to easily share interactive PDF documents by extending the functionality of Adobe Reader with additional usage rights. 

    The Reader Extension (Usage Rights) APIs adds usage rights to a PDF document. This action activates features that are not usually available when a PDF document is opened using Adobe Reader, such as adding comments to a document, filling forms, and saving the document. Third-party users do not require additional software or plug-ins to work with rights-enabled documents.

    When PDF documents have the appropriate usage rights added, recipients can do enabled activities from within Adobe Reader. 

Overall, [Doc Assurance APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager-forms-cloud-service-developer-reference/references/docassurance/) help you improve document security and compliance by adding an extra layer of control.


### Forms Service APIs

Forms service generates interactive PDF forms for data capture. It can also be used to import/export data to/from an existing interactive PDF form and validate submitted data. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities: 

* **Rendering Forms**: Generate an interactive PDF form from a template created using AEM Forms Designer and, optionally, XML data. This essentially produces a fillable PDF form optionally pre-filled with data.

* **Data Extraction and Import**: Import data into an existing PDF form as well as extract data from a filled PDF form. Both XDP and XML data formats are supported, and importing to non-XFA PDF forms (also known as AcroForms) additionally supports FDF and XFDF data.

* **Data Validation**: : Validate submitted data, in XDP or XML format, against a template created using AEM Forms Designer.

### Doc Generation API

The document generation API includes an optional feature that allows the direct upload of generated PDFs to Azure Blob Storage. Some key benefits of uploading PDFs directly to Azure Blob Storage using the document generation API are:

* **Seamless Integration with Cloud Storage**:
Directly uploading generated PDFs to Azure Blob Storage eliminates the need for additional manual or programmatic steps to transfer files, streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency.

* **Centralized Document Management**:
Storing PDFs in Azure Blob Storage allows for centralized management of documents, making it easier to organize, retrieve, and manage generated files across various use cases.

* **Improved Security**: By leveraging Azure's built-in security features, such as encryption at rest and role-based access control (RBAC), sensitive documents remain protected during storage.

* **Customizable Storage Paths**: The ability to define custom directory paths ensures generated PDFs are stored in organized and application-specific locations, improving file management.
