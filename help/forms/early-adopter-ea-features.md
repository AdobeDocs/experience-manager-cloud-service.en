### Workfront Fusion 

The [AEM Forms Adobe Workfront Fusion Connector](/help/forms/submit-adaptive-form-to-workfront-fusion.md) empowers seamless integration between Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms and Adobe Workfront Fusion. Adobe Workfront serves as a work management application, centralizing the entire work lifecycle, while Workfront Fusion acts as the integration platform facilitating connectivity between Workfront and various business applications. 

Using the AEM Forms Adobe Workfront Fusion Connector, you can design workflows that are triggered automatically upon submission of an Adaptive Form. For instance, envision a scenario where a workflow is initiated to assign a specific individual the task of reviewing submitted data, allowing approval or rejection of an application based on the information captured through the adaptive form. This streamlined integration enhances efficiency and brings a new level of automation to your workflow processes.

* **Preview before you submit**: Double-check everything before hitting submit. Preview your completed form to ensure accuracy and avoid any last-minute mistakes.

### AEM Forms to Marketo Connector

The AEM Forms to Marketo Connector bridges the gap between your web forms (Adaptive Forms) built with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and your marketing automation platform, Marketo. 

When someone submits a form on your website created with AEM Adaptive Forms, the connector ensures that the submitted data is automatically sent to Marketo. This eliminates the need for manual data entry and reduces the risk of errors. 

![AEM Form - Marketo Connector](/help/forms/assets/aem-forms-marketo-connector.jpeg)

By streamlining the data transfer process, the connector can help you improve your website's conversion rates. By automatically sending lead data to Marketo, you can ensure that qualified leads are quickly entered into your nurturing programs.

In essence, AEM Forms to Marketo Connector helps you leverage the strengths of both platforms to create a more efficient and effective marketing funnel.
