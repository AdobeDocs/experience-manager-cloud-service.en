# [!DNL AEM] Forms as a Cloud Service architecture {#architecture}

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Forms] as a Cloud Service is a cloud-native, Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for businesses to create, manage, publish, and update complex digital forms and communications while integrating submitted data with back-end processes, business rules, and saving data in an external data store. The service is always current, always available, and always learning.

You can use the service to create and roll out interactive and engaging digital forms and communications. For example, take an organization that is looking to digitize its customer enrollment journey and sending a communication with offers and next steps once the enrollment is complete. They have multiple data sources with existing customer data. They are looking to pre-populate forms, add e-sign their forms, and archive filled forms as PDF files. Besides, the organization has multiple print forms (PDF forms), they are also looking to convert all of their print forms to digital forms. AEM Forms as a Cloud Service is the best solution for such use cases.

The service provides a variable number of development, stage, and production environments along with tools to manage Author and Publish instances (Cloud Manager), manage user access and configure their identity providers (Admin Console and IMS (Adobe Identity management) system), configure caching (CDN), and cloud-native development environment.

The architecture is standard for every user and the service scales based on the actual traffic and activity. The base architecture of the service is identical to any Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service solution. For example, Sites and Assets. For detailed information on environments (development, stage, and production), scaling, and codebase(where you can store both configuration and custom code for your project), see [An Introduction to the Architecture of [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/core-concepts/architecture.html)

AEM Forms as a Cloud Service supports two major use cases: Digital Enrollment and Customer Communications. The following illustrations depict architecture for both the use cases.

## Components

Forms as a Cloud Service comprises multiple components:

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Every AEM Forms as a Cloud Service program has access to [built-in CDN service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/cdn.html). It is included in the license of Forms as a Cloud Services.

### Author

An Author is an AEM Forms as a Cloud Service instance running in the standard Author run mode. It is intended for internal users, forms designers, and developers. AEM Forms as a Cloud Service provides separate Author environments for development, stage, and production. An Author environment enables the following functionalities:

* Authoring and managing forms.
* Connecting to Automated forms conversion service to convert a PDF or XDP form to an adaptive form.
* Creating and running Forms-centric workflows.
* Managing adaptive forms assets.
* Managing Communications assets.
* Connecting with PDF Services APIs to <>
* Sync APIs (Real-time APIs) and Batch APIs to create, assemble, and deliver brand-oriented and personalized communications.
* Sync APIs to combine, rearrange, and validate PDF documents.

> ![NOTE]
> SMTP server is required to send emails. For example, a submission acknowledgment from Publish, or an approval/rejection mail from an Author workflow. Customers have to provide their own SMTP server.

### Publish

A Publish instance is an AEM Forms as a Cloud Service running in the standard Publish run mode. Publish instances are intended for end users of form-based applications, for example, users accessing a public website and submitting forms. It enables the following functionalities:

* Rendering and submitting forms for end users.
* Transporting of raw-submitted form data for further processing and storage in the final system-of-record.
* Connecting to Customer Managed Storage to store data.
* Connecting with Adobe Sign to e-sign an adaptive form.
* Sync APIs to create, assemble, and deliver brand-oriented and personalized communications.
* Sync APIs to combine, rearrange, and validate PDF documents.

User data submitted on the Publish instances is required by the workflows at Author instances for approval use-cases. So, publish instances also make HTTPS call to the author to persist submitted data. These calls are made to the public author endpoint.

#### Dispatcher

[Dispatcher](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/disp-overview.html) is Adobe Experience Manager’s caching and/or load-balancing tool that can be used in conjunction with an enterprise-class web server.

### Adobe Services

**Automated Forms Conversion Service**

Automated Forms Conversion service automatically converts your PDF forms to device-friendly, responsive, and HTML5-based adaptive forms. While leveraging the existing investments in PDF Forms and XFA, the service also applies appropriate validations, styling, and layout to adaptive form fields during conversion.

**Adobe Sign**
Adobe Sign is a cloud-based e-signature service that allows the user to send, sign, track, and manage signature processes using a browser or mobile device. You can integrate Adobe Sign with an adaptive form to automate signing workflows, simplify single and multi-signature processes, and to electronically sign adaptive forms.

<!-- **PDF Service API**
Adobe’s PDF Services API lets create, combine, export, and extract data from PDFs through powerful and flexible cloud-based APIs. -->

### Customer Managed Storage

Forms as a Cloud Service provide options to store content in an external storage system such as Blob Store, Database, or a storage service. You can also store in-process Workflows data (AEM Workflow Variables data) that contains Sensitive Personal Data (SPD) elements in a customer-managed repository for secure processing. Adobe recommends storing sensitive data on customer managed storages only.

You can use the **Unified Storage Connector** to connect to Blob Storage and **Form Data Model** to connect to  databases or backend services (RESTful, SOAP, and more).  

### Document Services

Document services constitutes of the following:  

* **Output Service (Communications - Document Generation APIs)** helps create brand-approved, personalized, and standardized documents such as business correspondences, statements, claim processing letters, benefit notices, monthly bills, or welcome kits.

* **Assembler Service (Communications - Document Manipulation APIs)** helps combine, rearrange, and validate PDF documents.

* **formsDorService** helps generate Document of Record (DoR). The service runs in its own pods separate form  Author and Publish instances of Forms as a Cloud Service. It helps provide a better performance and scale the pods independently depending on the load.  

We can mention that this is a separate service which allows the compute heavy DoR generation logic to run separate from Author/Publish and therefore improving their performance. This service would also scale independently based on the server load.

### Cloud Manager

Cloud Manager is an essential component to [AEM as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/overview/introduction.html). Each new tenant of the [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service is first provisioned for Cloud Manager access. Cloud Manager is the single-entry point for the operations and developer persona of our customers. It is the place from where the AEM programs and environments can be managed. Cloud Manager has evolved as a self-service portal where the main components of the AEM as a Cloud Service can be created and configured:

* Creating and managing programs
* Creating and managing the AEM environments within the programs
* Creating and managing the pipelines for deploying the customer code and configuration to a particular environment
* Getting notified of important lifecycle events for these components (for example, product updates)
For more information about Cloud Manager, see [Understand Adobe Cloud Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/foundation/cloud-manager/understand-cloud-manager-for-aem.html) and [Introduction to Cloud Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/introduction-to-cloud-manager.html).

### Developer Console

Each Forms as a Cloud Service program has a Developer Console. A Developer Console provides various details of each running Forms as a Cloud service environment. These details are helpful in debugging the environment. For details, see [Debugging AEM as a Cloud Service with the Developer Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/debugging/debugging-aem-as-a-cloud-service/developer-console.html).

## Users and Authentication {#users-and-authentication}

AEM as a Cloud Service includes Admin Console support for AEM instances and Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) based authentication. The Admin Console allows administrators to centrally manage all Experience Cloud users. Users and Groups can be assigned to product profiles associated with AEM as a Cloud Service instances, allowing them to log in to that instance. For more information about users, authentication, and, and accessing an instance of AEM as a Cloud Service, see [IMS Support for [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/security/ims-support.html?lang=en#introduction).

Various personas are involved in a typical [!DNL AEM Forms] project. After you log in to your [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service instance, you can [add users in admin console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/security/ims-support.html) for personas applicable to your organization or project and [assign users to built-in groups](forms-groups-privileges-tasks.md) to provide them required privileges.

To learn various in-built [!DNL AEM Forms] specific user groups and privileges available on [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Services instance, see [Configure, user, roles and groups](forms-groups-privileges-tasks.md). 

## Developer Experience {#developer-experience}

The new architecture supporting AEM as a Cloud Service brings some key changes to the overall developer experience. One of the major goals for the changes to developer experience is to allow migration to AEM as a Cloud Service as quickly as possible, with little modifications to existing custom code.

## Cloud development {#cloud-development}

Here are the guidelines to run your existing code smoothly on AEM as a Cloud Service environment:

* Store your code and configurations to the Git repository of the associated Cloud Manager program. It makes managing and integrating code with CI/CD a breeze.  
* Make application code and configuration compatible with the baseline [!DNL AEM Forms] images. Using the latest APIs helps to build faster and secure applications.
* Use the Cloud Manager pipeline associated with the Cloud Manager environment to build and deploy applications. It helps you bring the latest features and bug fixed for [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service to your environment.
* Try that your custom applications pass all the code quality, security, and performance gates enforced in the pipeline. It helps build secure and better performing applications which leads to better customer experience. You can always use Cloud Manager UI to skip some checks.
This process is commonly referred to as cloud-first development. [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service also provides an SDK to support rapid development before the pending code and configuration changes are attempted in the cloud.
Some interfaces that were previously part of the AEM QuickStart are no longer available to the users of the AEM as a Cloud Service environment. For instance, the Web Console where OSGI bundles and their associated configuration are managed. The CRXDE Lite content repository browser becomes only accessible on non-production environment types. A subset of the Web Console functionalities that developers require, especially when it comes to diagnostics and status purposes, is made available via a new developer console.
Also, one of the most common requirements for developers is quick access to the log files of the various environments. With [!DNL AEM Cloud Service], the log files of the different nodes in the Author, Publish are made available via the Cloud Manager, either in the form of files that can be downloaded or via APIs for tailing the logs. Due to the clear separation of code and content, developers can leverage a particular process for updating content as part of a deployment. The typical use cases for mutable content are:
* Standard “default” content that is part of the customer project (e.g. folders, templates, workflows...)
* Search index definitions
* ACLs and permissions
* Service users and user groups
Set up your development environment, [Configure your CI/CD Pipeline](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/how-to-use/configuring-pipeline.html), and learn to [deploy your code](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/how-to-use/deploying-code.html) on the environment. -->

### Adaptive Form Authoring {#local-development}

When you set up and configure an [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service environment, you set up development, staging, and production environments. In addition, set up and configure a local development environment for rapid iterations and development. You can download and set up AEM SDK and [!DNL AEM Forms] add-on feature archive to set up a local [!DNL Forms] as a Cloud Service development environment.  For detailed instructions, see [Set up a local development environment](setup-local-development-environment.md).

Form authors connect to a development environment for form editing. The final forms are brought into the production environment through package export/import or CI/CD.

Adobe recommends using AEM Developer SDK to develop and test features for Forms as a Cloud Service locally. The term Developer SDK is used to collectively represent the java docs, uber-jar, sources, and a cloud-ready quickstart for the customers to use. The Forms as a Cloud Service developer SDK consists of the Forms Add-On Feature Archive, Forms JavaDocs, Forms JavaScript Docs,  Forms Add-On API jar, and Docker images for Customer Communications.

## Debugging {#debugging}

AEM as a Cloud Service runs on self-service, scalable, cloud infrastructure. It requires AEM developers to understand and debug various facets of AEM as a Cloud Service, from build, and deploy to obtaining details of running AEM applications. For detailed information, see [Debugging AEM as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/debugging/debugging-aem-as-a-cloud-service/overview.html).
