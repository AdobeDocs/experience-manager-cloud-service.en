# [!DNL AEM] as a Cloud Service architecture {#architecture}

[!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service standardizes the deployment architecture for all customers, with the goal to completely free customers from architecture considerations. For instance, while the new AEM as a Cloud Service architecture still relies on the concept of micro-kernels for persistence, customers do not need to worry about which micro-kernel to pick from. The micro-kernels used both on the author and on the publish side are unique to [!DNL AEM Cloud Service] and otherwise not available to customers for on-premise installations.

AEM as a Cloud Service has a dynamic architecture with a variable number of AEM instances. It provides development, stage, production, and demonstration environments. It provides tools to manage AEM instances (Cloud Manager), maintain users and authentications (Admin Console and IMS (Adobe Identity management) system), configure caching (Fastly CDN), and cloud-native development environment. For more information on architecture see, [An Introduction to the Architecture of [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/core-concepts/architecture.html?lang=en).

## Components
Forms as a Cloud Service comprises multiple sub-components:

+++Adaptive Forms
Adaptive Forms enable customers to author web-friendly reflowable web forms and fragments that are used by the customers for their data capture needs. This feature enables customers to manage their complex data capture needs easily, by leveraging multiple integrations with Adobe Sign, Document Services, Form Data Model, Automated Forms Conversion service, and more.

+++

+++Automated Forms Conversion Service (AFCS)
Automated Forms Conversion service helps accelerate digitization and modernization of data capture experience through automated conversion of PDF forms to adaptive forms. The service, powered by Adobe Sensei, automatically converts your PDF forms to device-friendly, responsive, and HTML5-based adaptive forms. While leveraging the existing investments in PDF Forms and XFA, the service also applies appropriate validations, styling, and layout to adaptive form fields during conversion.

+++

+++Form Data Model
The Form Data Model (FDM) feature is the standard way of creating data integrations with external/internal data sources and using them across the different Forms as a Cloud Service features. FDM provides a rich editor for customers to integrate, define, and manage relationships between the different entities and data sources and perform operations on them.

+++

+++Forms Workflows
Forms-centric workflows is an extension to the default AEM Workflow and provides our customers with additional workflow capabilities like Form Data review, task assignment, and document services invocation.

+++

+++Communications
Forms as a Cloud Service offering consists of multiple services tailored specifically for document processing.

+++

+++Document of Record
A Document of Record is a PDF version of a form. It provides an ability to keep a record of the information  that you provide and submit in an Adaptive Form in PDF fromat. The service provides a default DoR template and tools to develop a custom template.

## Cloud Manager{#cloud-manager}

Cloud Manager is an essential component to [AEM as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/overview/introduction.html?lang=en). Each new tenant of the [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service is first provisioned for Cloud Manager access. Cloud Manager is the single-entry point for the operations and developer persona of our customers. It is the place from where the AEM programs and environments can be managed. Cloud Manager has evolved as a self-service portal where the main components of the AEM as a Cloud Service can be created and configured:

* Creating and managing programs
* Creating and managing the AEM environments within the programs
* Creating and managing the pipelines for deploying the customer code and configuration to a particular environment
* Getting notified of important lifecycle events for these components (e.g. product updates)
For more information about Cloud Manager, see [Understand Adobe Cloud Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/foundation/cloud-manager/understand-cloud-manager-for-aem.html) and [Introduction to Cloud Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/introduction-to-cloud-manager.html).

## Users and Authentication {#users-and-authentication}

AEM as a Cloud Service includes Admin Console support for AEM instances and Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) based authentication. The Admin Console allows administrators to centrally manage all Experience Cloud users. Users and Groups can be assigned to product profiles associated with AEM as a Cloud Service instances, allowing them to log in to that instance. For more information about users, authentication, and, and accessing an instance of AEM as a Cloud Service, see [IMS Support for [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/security/ims-support.html?lang=en#introduction).

Various personas are involved in a typical [!DNL AEM Forms] project. After you log in to your [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service instance, you can [add users in admin console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/security/ims-support.html) for personas applicable to your organization or project and [assign users to built-in groups](forms-groups-privileges-tasks.md) to provide them required privileges.

To learn various in-built [!DNL AEM Forms] specific user groups and privileges available on [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Services instance, see [Configure, user, roles and groups](forms-groups-privileges-tasks.md).

## Developer Experience {#developer-experience}

The new architecture supporting AEM as a Cloud Service brings some key changes to the overall developer experience. One of the major goals for the changes to developer experience is to allow migration to AEM as a Cloud Service as quickly as possible, with little modifications to existing custom code.

## Cloud development {#cloud-development}

Here are the guidelines to run your existing code smoothly on AEM as a Cloud Service environment:

* Store your code and configurations to the Git repository of the associated Cloud Manager program. It makes managing and integrating code with CI/CD a breeze.  
* Make application code and configuration compatible with the baseline [!DNL AEM Forms] images. Using the latest APIs helps to build faster and secure applications.
* Use the Cloud Manager pipeline associated with the Cloud Manager environment to build and deploy applications. It helps you bring the latest features and bug fixed for [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service to your environment.
* Try that your custom applications pass all the code quality, security, and performance gates enforced in the pipeline. It helps build secure and better performing applications which leads to better customer experience. You can always use Cloud Manager UI to skip some checks.
This process is commonly referred to as cloud-first development. [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service also provides an SDK to support rapid development before the pending code and configuration changes are attempted in the cloud.
Some interfaces that were previously part of the AEM QuickStart are no longer available to the users of the AEM as a Cloud Service environment. For instance, the Web Console where OSGI bundles and their associated configuration are managed. The CRXDE Lite content repository browser becomes only accessible on non-production environment types. A subset of the Web Console functionalities that developers require, especially when it comes to diagnostics and status purposes, is made available via a new developer console.
Also, one of the most common requirements for developers is quick access to the log files of the various environments. With [!DNL AEM Cloud Service], the log files of the different nodes in the Author, Publish are made available via the Cloud Manager, either in the form of files that can be downloaded or via APIs for tailing the logs. Due to the clear separation of code and content, developers can leverage a particular process for updating content as part of a deployment. The typical use cases for mutable content are:
* Standard “default” content that is part of the customer project (e.g. folders, templates, workflows...)
* Search index definitions
* ACLs and permissions
* Service users and user groups
Set up your development environment, [Configure your CI/CD Pipeline](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/how-to-use/configuring-pipeline.html), and learn to [deploy your code](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/how-to-use/deploying-code.html) on the environment.

## Local development {#local-development}

When you set up and configure an [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service environment, you set up development, staging, and production environments. In addition, set up and configure a local development environment for rapid iterations and development. You can download and set up AEM SDK and [!DNL AEM Forms] add-on feature archive to set up a local [!DNL Forms] as a Cloud Service development environment.  For detailed instructions, see [Set up a local development environment](setup-local-development-environment.md).





## Debugging {#debugging}

AEM as a Cloud Service runs on self-service, scalable, cloud infrastructure. It requires AEM developers to understand and debug various facets of AEM as a Cloud Service, from build and deploy to obtaining details of running AEM applications. For detailed information, see [Debugging AEM as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/debugging/debugging-aem-as-a-cloud-service/overview.html?lang=en).
