## Connect your AEM Forms environment with hCaptcha {#connect-your-forms-environment-with-hcaptcha-service}

hCaptcha service protects your forms from bots, spam, and automated abuse. It poses a checkbox widget challenge and evaluates the user response to determine if itâ€™s a human or a bot interacting with the form. It prevents the user to proceed if the test fails and helps make online transactions secure by keeping bots from posting spam or malicious activities.

AEM Forms as a Cloud Service supports hCaptcha in Adaptive Forms. You can use it to present a checkbox widget challenge on form submission. To integrate AEM Forms with hCaptcha service, perform the following steps:

    1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Tools > General > Configuration Browser]**.  
    1. In the Configuration Browser, you can select an existing folder or create a folder. You can create a folder and enable the Cloud Configurations option for it or Enable the Cloud Configurations option for an existing folder:

    * **Error Message:** Provide the error message to display to the user when the Captcha submission fails.
    * **Captcha Size:** You can select the display size of the hCaptcha challenge dialog. Use the **[!UICONTROL Compact]** option to display a small sized and the **[!UICONTROL Normal]** option to display a relatively large-size hCaptcha challenge dialog or **[!UICONTROL Invisible]** to validate hCaptcha without explicitly rendering the checkbox widget on the user interface.
