![Data integration](do-not-localize/data-integeration.png)

[!DNL Experience Manager Forms] Data Integration lets you configure and connect to disparate data sources. The following types are supported out-of-the-box:

* Relational databases - MySQL, [!DNL Microsoft® SQL Server], [!DNL IBM® DB2®], postgreSQL, and [!DNL Oracle RDBMS] 
* RESTful web services  
* SOAP-based web services
* OData services (Version 4.0)
* Microsoft&reg; Dynamics
* SalesForce
* Microsoft&reg; Azure Blob Storage

Data integration supports OAuth2.0([Authorization Code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/), [Client Credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/)), Basic Authentication, and API Key authentication types out-of-the-box, and allows implementing custom authentication for accessing web services. While RESTful, SOAP-based, and OData services are configured in [!DNL Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service, JDBC for relational databases and connector for [!DNL Experience Manager] user profile are configured in [!DNL Experience Manager] web console.

## Configure relational database {#configure-relational-database}

### Prerequisites

Before configuring relational databases using [!DNL Experience Manager] Web Console Configuration, it is mandatory to:
* [Enable advanced networking through the cloud manager API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/networking/advanced-networking.html), as ports are disabled by default.  
* [Add JDBC driver dependencies in Maven](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/networking/examples/sql-datasourcepool.html?lang=en#mysql-driver-dependencies).


### Steps to configure a relational database

You can configure relational databases using [!DNL Experience Manager] Web Console Configuration. Do the following:

1. Go to [!DNL Experience Manager] web console at `https://server:host/system/console/configMgr`.
1. Locate **[!UICONTROL Day Commons JDBC Connections Pools]** configuration. Select to open the configuration in edit mode.

   ![JDBC Connector Pool](/help/forms/assets/jdbc_connector.png)

1. In the configuration dialog, specify the details for the database you want to configure, such as:

    * Java&trade; class name for the JDBC driver
    * JDBC connection URI
    * Username and password to establish connection with the JDBC driver
    * Specify a SQL SELECT query in the **[!UICONTROL Validation Query]** field to validate connections from the pool. The query must return at least one row. Based on your database, specify one of the following:
      * SELECT 1 (MySQL and MS® SQL) 
      * SELECT 1 from dual (Oracle)
    * Name of the data source

   Sample strings for configuring a relational database:

   ```text
      "datasource.name": "sqldatasourcename-mysql",
      "jdbc.driver.class": "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver",
      "jdbc.connection.uri": "jdbc:mysql://$[env:AEM_PROXY_HOST;default=proxy.tunnel]:30001/sqldatasourcename"
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > See [SQL connections using JDBC DataSourcePool](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/networking/examples/sql-datasourcepool.html) for more detailed information.
    
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the configuration.

Now, you can use the configured relational database with your Form Data Model (FDM). 

<!-- ## Configure [!DNL Experience Manager] user profile {#configure-aem-user-profile}

You can configure [!DNL Experience Manager] user profile using User Profile Connector configuration in [!DNL Experience Manager] Web Console. Do the following:

1. Go to [!DNL Experience Manager] web console at `https://[server]:[port]/system/console/configMgr`.
1. Look for **[!UICONTROL AEM Forms Data Integrations - User Profile Connector Configuration]** and select to open the configuration in edit mode.
1. In the User Profile Connector Configuration dialog, you can add, remove, or update user profile properties. The specified properties are available for use in form data model (FDM). Use the following format to specify user profile properties:

   `name=[property_name_with_location_in_user_profile],type=[property_type]`

   Examples:

    * `name=profile/phoneNumber,type=string`
    * `name=profile/empLocation/*/city,type=string`

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The **&#42;** in the above example denotes all nodes under the `profile/empLocation/` node in [!DNL Experience Manager] user profile in CRXDE structure. It means that the Form Data Model (FDM) can access the `city` property of type `string` present in any node under the `profile/empLocation/` node. However, the nodes that contain the specified property must follow a consistent structure.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the configuration. -->

## Configure folder for cloud service configurations {#cloud-folder}

Configuration for cloud services folder is required for configuring cloud services for RESTful, SOAP, and OData services.

All cloud service configurations in [!DNL Experience Manager] are consolidated in the `/conf` folder in [!DNL Experience Manager] repository.

    * Select the authentication type — None, OAuth2.0([Authorization Code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/), [Client Credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/)), Basic Authentication, or Custom Authentication — to access the SOAP service, and accordingly provide the details for authentication.

      <!--If you select **[!UICONTROL X509 Token]** as the Authentication type, configure the X509 certificate. For more information, see [Set up certificates](install-configure-document-services.md#set-up-certificates-for-reader-extension-and-encryption-service).-->
      <!--Specify the KeyStore alias for the X509 certificate in the **[!UICONTROL Key Alias]** field. Specify the time, in seconds, until the authentication request remains valid, in the **[!UICONTROL Time To Live]** field. Optionally, select to sign the message body or timestamp header or both.-->

      <!--If you select **[!UICONTROL Mutual Authentication]** as the authentication type, see [Certificate-based mutual authentication for RESTful and SOAP web services](#mutual-authentication).-->

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Create]** to create the cloud configuration for the SOAP web service.

### Enable the use of import statements in SOAP web services WSDL {#enable-import-statements}

You can specify a regular expression that serves as the filter for absolute URLs that are allowed as import statements in SOAP web services WSDL. By default, there is no value in this field. As a result, [!DNL Experience Manager] blocks all import statements available in WSDL. If you specify `.*` as the value in this field, [!DNL Experience Manager] allows all import statements.

Set the `importAllowlistPattern` property of the **[!UICONTROL Form Data Model SOAP Web Services Import Allowlist]** configuration to specify the regular expression. The following JSON file displays a sample:

```json
{
  "importAllowlistPattern": ".*"
}
```
