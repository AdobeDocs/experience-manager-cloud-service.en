# List forms on the Sites page

Imagine a user visiting the bankâ€™s website in search of an account opening form. The bank uses the Forms Portal component to help users quickly find the form by entering specific keywords or filtering by categories such as 'New Accounts' or 'Personal Banking' and allows users to easily locate the desired form without having to scroll through lengthy lists.

The **Search & Lister** component of the Forms Portal allows you to display and list forms on a Sites page. Users can configure and present a comprehensive list of forms based on specific criteria to meet organizational requirements. Anonymous users can visit the Sites page to view and browse the available forms. The listed forms can be sorted in ascending or descending order using the **Sort By** drop-down option located in the upper-right corner of the screen.

## Pre-requisite

Before exploring the various capabilities of a Forms Portal component, ensure that Core Components are enabled for your environment. For detailed instructions on how to enable Core Components for your environment, [click here](/help/forms/enable-adaptive-forms-core-components.md).

<!--
## Enable Forms Portal components for your existing environment

To enable out-of-the-box Forms Portal components on existing AEM Forms as a Cloud Service, perform the following steps:

1. **Clone Cloud Manager Git repository on your local development instance:**  Your Cloud Manager Git repository contains a default AEM project. It is based on [AEM Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/). Clone your Cloud Manager Git Repository using Self-Service Git Account Management from Cloud Manager UI to bring the project on your local development environment. For details on accessing the repository, see [Accessing Repositories](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/managing-code/accessing-repos.html).  

1. **Create [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [Cloud Service] project:** Create [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [Cloud Service] project based on [AEM Archetype 50](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/releases/tag/aem-project-archetype-50) or later. The archetype help developers easily start developing for [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service. It also includes some sample themes and templates to help you started quickly.

    To create [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a Cloud Service project, open the command prompt and run the below command. To include [!DNL Forms] specific configurations, themes, and templates, set `includeForms=y`.  

    ```shell
    mvn -B archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.adobe.aem -DarchetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=30 -DaemVersion="cloud" -DappTitle="My Site" -DappId="mysite" -DgroupId="com.mysite" -DincludeForms="y"
    ```

    Also, change `appTitle`, `appId`, and `groupId`, in the above command to reflect your environment.

    After the project is ready, update the `<core.forms.components.version>x.y.z</core.forms.components.version>` property in the top-level `pom.xml` of the Archetype project to reflect the latest version of [core-forms-components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components) in your `AEM Archetype` project. 
 
1. **Deploy the project to your local development environment:** You can use the following command to deploy to your local development environment

    `mvn -PautoInstallPackage clean install`

    For the complete list of commands, see [Building and Installing](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/using.html?lang=en#building-and-installing)

1. [Deploy the archetype to your [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service environment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/developing/aem-project-content-package-structure.html#embeddeds). -->

After deploying the latest Core Components to your environment, the Forms Portal components become accessible in your authoring environment.

## List forms on the Sites Page

To add the **Search & Lister** portal component to your Sites page, perform the following steps:

1. Open the AEM Sites page in an **Edit** mode.

## Enable Forms Portal Components {#enable-forms-portal-components}

To use any core component (including the out-of-the-box portal components) in an Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) site, you must create a proxy component and enable it for your site. For creating a proxy component and enabling portal components, see [Using Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/get-started/using.html?lang=en#create-proxy-components). 

Once a portal component is enabled, you can use it in the author instance of your sites page.

## Add and Configure Forms Portal Components {#configure-forms-portal-components}

You can create and customize Forms Portal on websites authored using AEM by adding and configuring the portal components. Ensure that the [components are enabled](#enable-forms-portal-components) before using them in the Forms Portal.

To add a component, either drag and drop the component from the Components pane to the layout container on the page, or select the add icon on the layout container and add the component from the [!UICONTROL Insert New Component] dialog.

### Configure Drafts & Submissions Component {#configure-drafts-submissions-component}

## Configure Asynchronous Form Submission Using Adobe Sign {#configure-asynchronous-form-submission-using-adobe-sign}

You can configure to submit an adaptive form only when all the recipients have completed the signing ceremony. Follow the steps below to configure the setting using Adobe Sign.

1. In the author instance, open an Adaptive Form in the edit mode.
1. From the left pane, select the Properties icon and expand the **[!UICONTROL ELECTRONIC SIGNTATURE]** option.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Enable Adobe Sign]**. Various configuration options display. 
1. In the [!UICONTROL Submit the form] section, select the **[!UICONTROL after every recipient completes signing ceremony]** option to configure the Submit Form action, where the form is first sent to all the recipients for signing. Once all the recipients have signed the form, only then the form is submitted. 

## Save Adaptive Forms As Drafts {#save-adaptive-forms-as-drafts}

You can save forms as Drafts for completing them later. There are two ways in which a form is saved as a draft:

* Create a "Save Form" rule on a form component, for example, a button. On clicking the button, the rule triggers and the form are saved a draft.
* Enable Auto-Save feature, which saves the form as per the specified event or after a configured interval of time.

### Create Rules to Save an Adaptive Form as Draft {#rule-to-save-adaptive-form-as-draft}

To create a "Save Form" rule on a form component, for example, a button, follow the steps below:

1. In the author instance, open an Adaptive Form in edit mode.
1. From the left pane, select ![Components icon](assets/components_icon.png) and drag the [!UICONTROL Button] component to the form.
1. Select the [!UICONTROL Button] component and then select the ![Configure icon](assets/configure_icon.png).

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Done]** to save the rule.

### Enable Auto-save {#enable-auto-save}

You can configure the auto-save feature for an adaptive form as follows:

1. In the author instance, open an Adaptive Form in edit mode.
1. From the left pane, select the ![Properties icon](assets/configure_icon.png) and expand the [!UICONTROL AUTO-SAVE] option.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Enable]** check box to enable auto-save of the form. You can configure the following:
* By default, the [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Event] is set to "true", which implies that the form is auto-saved after every event.
* In [!UICONTROL Trigger], configure to trigger auto-save based on the occurrence of an event or after a specific interval of time.
