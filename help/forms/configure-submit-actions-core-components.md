A Submit Action lets you choose the destination of data captured via an Adaptive Form. It is triggered when a user clicks the **[!UICONTROL Submit]** button on an Adaptive Form. Forms as a Cloud Service, for Adaptive Forms based on Core Components, offers an array of pre-built Submit Actions. These out-of-the-box submit actions empower you to: 

* Effortlessly send form data via email.
* Initiate Microsoft® Power Automate flows or AEM Workflows while transmitting the data.
* Directly transmit the form data to Microsoft® SharePoint Server, Microsoft® Azure Blob Storage, or Microsoft® OneDrive.
* Seamlessly send the data to a configured data source using the Form Data Model.
* Conveniently submit the data to a REST endpoint.

You can [extend the default Submit Actions](custom-submit-action-form.md). You can also customize the Submit Actions for organizational-specific requirements.

## Submit to Microsoft® SharePoint {#submit-to-sharedrive}

The **[!UICONTROL Submit to SharePoint]** Submit Action connects an Adaptive Form with a Microsoft&reg; SharePoint Storage. You can submit the form data files, attachments, or Document of Record to the connected Microsoft&reg; Sharepoint Storage. 

Integration of AEM Adaptive Form with Microsoft® SharePoint enables the submission, retrieval, or storage of data, files, and other relevant information within the SharePoint storage. To learn how to configure submit to SharePoint submit action for an Adaptive Form, [click here.](/help/forms/configure-submit-action-sharepoint.md) 

## Submit using Form Data Model {#submit-using-form-data-model}

The **[!UICONTROL Submit using Form Data Model]** Submit Action writes submitted Adaptive Form data for the specified data model object in a Form Data Model to its data source. When configuring the Submit Action, you can choose a data model object whose submitted data you want to write back to its data source.

When a user submits a form based on a form data model, you can [configure the form to write the submitted data to the data sources associated with the data model object.](/help/forms/using-form-data-model.md#write-submitted-adaptive-form-data-into-data-sources-write-af)

## Submit to REST endpoint {#submit-to-rest-endpoint}

The **[!UICONTROL Submit to REST Endpoint]** submit action sends the submitted data to a REST URL. This URL can be either an internal server (the server where the form is displayed) or an external server. The data of an Adaptive Form is submitted to a REST URL using the **[!UICONTROL Submit to REST endpoint]** Submit Action.

For a comprehensive guide on the detailed steps to post or submit data to a REST URL, refer to [configure submit to REST Endpoint submit action for Adaptive Forms.](/help/forms/configure-submit-action-restpoint.md)

## Invoke an AEM Workflow {#invoke-an-aem-workflow}

The **[!UICONTROL Invoke an AEM Workflow]** Submit Action integrates an Adaptive Form with an [AEM Workflow](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/developing/extending-aem/extending-workflows/workflows-models.html?lang=en#extending-aem). When a form is submitted, the selected workflow starts automatically. 

 [Integrate AEM Adaptive Form with AEM Workflow: Streamlining Business Processes](/help/forms/configure-submit-action-workflow.md) provides step-by-step instructions to seamlessly integrate AEM Workflow with Adaptive Forms, optimizing business processes and enhancing workflow automation.

## Submit to OneDrive {#submit-to-onedrive}

The **[!UICONTROL Submit to OneDrive]** Submit Action connects an Adaptive Form with a Microsoft&reg; OneDrive. You can submit the form data, files, attachments, or Document of Record to the connected Microsoft&reg; OneDrive Storage. 

AEM Forms Cloud Service with Microsoft® OneDrive helps in optimize data submission. Explore the steps of [integrating OneDrive with AEM Forms](/help/forms/configure-submit-action-onedrive.md) for streamlined and secure storage.

## Submit to Azure Blob Storage {#submit-to-azure-blob-storage}

The **[!UICONTROL Submit to Azure Blob Storage]** Submit Action connects an Adaptive Form with a Microsoft® Azure portal and allows you to submit various elements such as form data, files, attachments, or Document of Record to the associated Azure Storage containers.

AEM as a Cloud Service allows submitting data to Azure Storage from AEM Adaptive Forms. Learn how to [create and use Azure Blob Storage configuration in AEM Forms](/help/forms/configure-submit-action-azure-blob-storage.md) for efficient data storage. 

To set values of a configuration, [Generate OSGi Configurations using the AEM SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/deploying/configuring-osgi.html?lang=en#generating-osgi-configurations-using-the-aem-sdk-quickstart), and [deploy the configuration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/using-cloud-manager/deploy-code.html?lang=en#deployment-process) to your Cloud Service instance.

## Submit to Power Automate {#microsoft-power-automate}

You can configure an Adaptive Form to run a Microsoft&reg; Power Automate Cloud Flow on submission. The configured Adaptive Form sends captured data, attachments, and Document Of Record to Power Automate Cloud Flow for processing. It helps you build custom data capture experience while harnessing the power of Microsoft&reg; Power Automate to build business logics around captured data and automate customer workflows. 
Adaptive Forms editor provides the **Invoke a Microsoft&reg; Power Automate flow** submit action to send adaptive forms data, attachments, and Document Of Record to Power Automate Cloud Flow. To use the Submit action to send captured data to Microsoft&reg; Power Automate, [Connect your Forms as a Cloud Service instance with Microsoft&reg; Power Automate](forms-microsoft-power-automate-integration.md)  

After a successful configuration, use the [Invoke a Microsoft&reg; Power Automate flow](forms-microsoft-power-automate-integration.md#use-the-invoke-a-microsoft&reg;-power-automate-flow-submit-action-to-send-data-to-a-power-automate-flow-use-the-invoke-microsoft-power-automate-flow-submit-action) submit action to send data to a Power Automate Flow.  

## Submit to Workfront Fusion {#workfront-fusion}

You can configure an Adaptive Form to submit data to Workfront Fusion on submission. Workfront Fusion allows automation of processes so that user can concentrate on new tasks rather than repeating the same tasks again and again. It automates both simple and complex tasks, saving time and ensuring consistent process execution.

The Adaptive Forms editor provides the **Invoke a WorkFront Fusion Scenario** submit action to send Adaptive Forms data or attachments to a Workfront Fusion scenario. To use the submit action for sending captured data to a Workfront Fusion scenario, refer to [Submit an Adaptive Form to Adobe Workfront Fusion](/help/forms/submit-adaptive-form-to-workfront-fusion.md).

## Send PDF via Email {#send-pdf-via-email}

The **Send PDF via Email** Submit Action sends an email with a PDF containing form data, to one or more recipients on successful submission of the form.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This Submit Action is available for XFA-based Adaptive Forms and XSD-based adaption forms that have the Document of Record template. 

-->

<!-- ## Invoke a forms workflow {#invoke-a-forms-workflow}

The **Submit to Forms workflow** submit option sends a data xml and file attachments (if any) to an existing Adobe LiveCycle or [!DNL AEM Forms] on JEE process.

For information about how to configure the Submit to forms workflow Submit Action, see [Submitting and processing your form data using forms workflows](submit-form-data-livecycle-process.md). -->

<!--
## Forms Portal Submit Action {#forms-portal-submit-action}

The **Forms Portal Submit Action** option makes form data available through an [!DNL AEM Forms] portal.

For more information about the Forms Portal and Submit Action, see [Drafts and submissions component](draft-submission-component.md). -->

## Use synchronous or asynchronous submission {#use-synchronous-or-asynchronous-submission}

A Submit Action can use synchronous or asynchronous submission.

**Synchronous submission**: Traditionally, web forms are configured to submit synchronously. In a synchronous submission, when users submit a form, they are redirected to an acknowledgment page, a thank you page, or if there is submission failure, an error page. You can select the **[!UICONTROL Use asynchronous submission]** option to redirect the users to a webpage or show a message on submission.  

![Configure Submit Action](assets/thank-you-setting.png)

**Asynchronous submission**: Modern web experiences like single page applications are gaining popularity where the web page remains static while client-server interaction happens in the background. You can now provide this experience with Adaptive Forms by [configuring asynchronous submission](asynchronous-submissions-adaptive-forms.md).

## Server-Side Revalidation in Adaptive Form {#server-side-revalidation-in-adaptive-form}

Typically, in any online data capture system, developers place someJavaScript validations on client side to enforce a few business rules. But in modern browsers, end users have way to bypass those validations and manually do submissions using various techniques, Such as Web Browser DevTools Console. Such techniques are also valid for Adaptive Forms. A forms developer can create various validation logics, but technically, end users can bypass those validation logics and submit invalid data to the server. Invalid data would break the business rules that a form author has enforced.

The server-side revalidation feature provides the ability to run the validations that an Adaptive Forms author has provided while designing an Adaptive Form on the server. It prevents any possible compromise of data submissions and business rules violations represented in terms of form validations.

### What to validate on Server? {#what-to-validate-on-server-br}

All out of the box (OOTB) field validations of an Adaptive Form that are rerun at the server are:

* Required
* Validation Picture Clause
* Validation Expression

### Enabling Server-side Validation {#enabling-server-side-validation-br}

Use the **[!UICONTROL Revalidate on server]** under Adaptive Form Container in the sidebar to enable or disable server-side validation for the current form.

![Enabling Server-Side Validation](assets/revalidate-on-server.png)

Enabling Server-Side Validation

If end-user bypass those validations and submit the forms, the server again performs the validation. If the validation fails at server end, then the submit transaction is stopped. The user is presented with the original form again. The captured data and submitted data are presented to the user as an error.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Server-side validation validates the form model. You are recommended to create a separate client library for validations and not mix it with other things like HTML styling and DOM manipulation in the same client library.

### Supporting Custom functions in Validation Expressions {#supporting-custom-functions-in-validation-expressions-br}

At times, if there are **complex validation rules**, the exact validation script reside in custom functions and author calls these custom functions from field validation expression. To make this custom function library known and available while performing server-side validations, the form author can configure the name of AEM client library under the **[!UICONTROL Basic]** tab of Adaptive Form Container properties as shown below.

![Supporting Custom functions in Validation Expressions](assets/clientlib-cat.png)

Supporting Custom functions in Validation Expressions

Author can configure customJavaScript library per Adaptive Form. In the library, only keep the reusable functions, which have dependency on jquery and underscore.js third-party libraries.

## Error handling on Submit Action {#error-handling-on-submit-action}

As a part of AEM security and hardening guidelines, configure custom error pages such as 400.jsp, 404.jsp, and 500.jsp. These handlers are called, when on submitting a form 400, 404, or 500 errors appear. The handlers are also called when these error codes are triggered on the Publish node. You can also create JSP pages for other HTTP error codes.

When you prefill a form data model, or schema based Adaptive Form with XML or JSON data complaint to a schema that is data does not contain `<afData>`, `<afBoundData>`, and `</afUnboundData>` tags, then the data of unbounded fields of the Adaptive Form is lost. The schema can be an XML schema, JSON schema, or a Form Data Model. Unbounded fields are Adaptive Form fields without the `bindref` property.
