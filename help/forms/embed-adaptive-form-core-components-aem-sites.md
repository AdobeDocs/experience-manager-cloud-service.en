# Create or add an Adaptive Form using AEM Sites Editor {#add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page}

You can seamlessly author or embed Adaptive Forms in an AEM Sites page to allow your users to fill and submit a form without leaving the Sites page. It helps user remain in context of other elements of the web page and simultaneously interact with the form. 
 
You can choose one the following methods to create or add an Adaptive Form to an AEM Sites page:

* **Create an Adaptive Form using Adaptive Forms Container component**: The [Adaptive Form Container](#af-container-component) component  allows you to build digital enrollment experiences by utilizing Adaptive Forms components directly within the AEM Sites editor. This integration provides a seamless experience to AEM Sites authors who want to create and manage forms within their AEM Sites pages.
 
* **Add an existing Adaptive Form**: The [Adaptive Forms - Embed(v2)](#embed-existing-af) component allows you to easily add a pre-existing Adaptive Form into a page within AEM Sites. This feature enhances the adaptability and reusability of Adaptive Forms. This integration provides a convenient way for customers to reuse Adaptive Forms they have already created. 

* **Use Adaptive Forms Wizard to create a form**: Use the [Adaptive Forms - Embed(v2)](#embed-new-af) component to create an Adaptive Form from within the AEM Sites editor using Form Creation wizard. The form is saved as an external entity. You can reuse this form in other Sites pages and standalone forms also. 

* **Add multiple Adaptive Forms in an AEM Sites page**: To add multiple Adaptive Forms in an AEM Sites page, use the AEM Forms container components - [Adaptive Forms - Embed(v2)](#embed-new-af) and [Adaptive Form Container](#af-container-component). In case, you need to add more than one Adaptive Form as a div within an AEM Sites page, you can use the Adaptive Form Container component.

You can use the Rule Editor to add or control the dynamic behavior of Adaptive Form components. For example, hide or show a component. The Rule Editor is not available for non-Adaptive Form components. So, use your diligence while using non-Adaptive Form components in AEM Forms Container component.

## Create an Adaptive Form using Adaptive Forms Container component {#af-container-component}

The [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Container] component allows building digital enrollment experiences using Adaptive Forms components in the AEM Sites editor. You can create an Adaptive Form by dragging and dropping the form components.

  1. Open your [AEM Forms Archetype or Cloned Git Repository](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/overview.html) project in a text editor. For example, Visual Studio Code. 
  1. Navigate to `ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/corecomponents/components/page/.content.xml`.
  1. Copy the value of `sling:resourceSuperType`. For instance, the value is `core/wcm/components/page/v3/page`.

      ![sling resource](/help/forms/assets/slingresource.png)

  1. Create the similar structure at the location `ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps` same as `core/wcm/components/page/v3/page`.

      ![overlay structure](/help/forms/assets/overlaystructure.png)

  1. Add `customheaderlibs.html` and `customfooterlibs.html` files.

        ```
        //Customheaderlibs.html
        <sly data-sly-use.clientlib="core/wcm/components/commons/v1/templates/clientlib.html">
            <sly data-sly-call="${clientlib.css @ categories='core.forms.components.runtime.all'}"/>

### Publish added Adaptive Forms using Adaptive Form - Embed(v2) component  {#publish-embedded-adaptive-form}

Consider the following scenarios for publishing added Adaptive Forms using the **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Form - Embed(v2)]** component: 

* When you publish an AEM Sites page for the first time, the forms added to the Sites page are published automatically. 
* When you modify an Adaptive Form added to an already published Sites page, manually publish the corresponding Adaptive Forms. 
* When you modify a Sites page and the corresponding Adaptive Forms, republish the Sites page and all the Adaptive Forms added to the Sites page.

### Modify added Adaptive Forms using Adaptive Form - Embed(v2) component  {#modifying-embedded-adaptive-form}

To modify any configuration or property of an Adaptive Form, do one of the following:

* Open the original form in an Adaptive Form  in respective editor and modify them.
* Tap the Adaptive Form  from within the site page in edit mode and then tap **[!UICONTROL Edit in a new window]**. The original form opens in edit mode that you can modify.

## Change Layout of an Adaptive Form added to an AEM Sites page {#change-layout-af-aem-sites-page} 

In AEM Sites page, the [Layout mode](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/features/responsive-layout.html?#defining-layouts-layout-mode) enables you to resize an Adaptive Form that is created or added to an AEM Sites page.

![AF-layout-support](/help/forms/assets/afsite-layoutsupport.gif)

AEM sites page maintains a reference to the Adaptive Form. When you translate an AEM Sites page, it automatically translates an Adaptive Form and its associated referenced assets using the [translation projects](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/reusing-content/translation/managing-projects.html?lang=en#adding-pages-assets-to-a-translation-job) into other languages.

## Best practices {#best-practices}

* Header and footer in the original form are not included in the embedded form.
* User drafts and submissions of embedded forms are supported and visible in Drafts and Submitted Forms tabs on the Forms Portal.
