<!--

### New features available in [!DNL Forms] prerelease channel {#prerelease-features-forms-sep-2021}

* **Forms Portal:**  In a typical forms-centric portal deployment scenario, forms development and portal development are two disjoint activities. While Form Designers design and store forms in a repository, Web Developers create a web application to list forms and handle submission of forms. Forms are copied over to the web tier as there is no communication between the forms repository and the web application.

  Such scenarios often result in management issues and production delays. For example, if there is a newer version of a form available in the repository, you need to replace the form on the web tier, modify the web application, and redeploy the form on the public site. Redeploying the web application might cause some server downtime. Typically, the server downtime is a planned activity and therefore the changes cannot be pushed to the public site instantaneously.

  AEM Forms provides portal components that reduce management overheads and production delays. The components equip Web Developers to create and customize a forms portal on websites authored using Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). The form portal components allow you to add the following functionality:

  * List forms in customized layouts. Out of the box, List view and Card view are provided.

  * List published adaptive forms on an AEM Sites page.

  * Enable searching of forms based on a various criteria, such as form properties, metadata, and tags.

  * Lists drafts and submissions related to Adaptive Form created by end user.
