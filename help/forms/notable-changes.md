Before proceeding with the service, please take into account the following exceptional cases:

+++ 1. Adaptive Forms 

* **XSD-Based Adaptive Forms:** The service does not support HTML5 Forms (Mobile Forms). If you render your XDP-based forms as HTML5 Forms, you can continue using the feature on AEM 6.5 Forms. You can use XDP-template to design a template for Document for Record. The service does not support XFA based Adaptive Forms  
* **Importing Adaptive Form templates:** Use build pipeline and corresponding Git repository of your program to import existing Adaptive Form templates. 
*  **Rule editor:** AEM Forms as a Cloud Service provides a hardened [Rule editor](rule-editor.md#visual-rule-editor). The code editor is not available on Forms as a Cloud Service. The migration utility helps you migrate your forms that have custom rules (created in code editor). The utility converts such rules into custom functions supported on Forms as a Cloud Service. You can use the reusable functions with Rule editor to continue obtaining results obtained with rule scripts  The `onSubmitError` or `onSubmitSuccess` functions are now available as actions the Rule Editor.  
* **Drafts and submissions:** The service does not retain metadata for drafts and submitted Adaptive Forms.  
* **Prefill Service:** By default, the prefill service merges data with an Adaptive Form at client as opposed to merging data on Server in AEM 6.5 Forms. The feature helps improve the time required to prefill an Adaptive Form. You can always configure to run the merge action on the Adobe Experience Manager Forms Server. 
* **Submit actions:** The **Email as PDF** action is not available. The **Email** submit action provide options to send attachments and attach Document of Record (DoR) with email. 
* **Components**:  The service does not support in-form signing experience and does not include the Summary and Verify components for Adaptive Forms.  



+++


+++ 2. Document Services: Document Manipulation APIs (Assembler Service)


The service does not support operations dependent on other services or applications:  

* Conversion of documents in a non-PDF format to a PDF format is not supported. For example, Microsoft Word to PDF, Microsoft Excel to PDF, and HTML to PDF are not supported. If your documents are in a non-PDF format. Convert such documents to PDF format before using those with Communications Document Manipulation APIs. For example, if your documents are in Microsoft Office, HTML, PostScript (PS), XDP format, convert these documents to PDF format before using those with PDF documents. 
* Adobe Distiller-based conversions are not supported. For example, PostScript(PS) to PDF
* Forms Service-based conversions are not supported. For example, XDP to PDF Forms.
* The service does not support converting a Signed PDF or Transparent PDF to another PDF format.
* Applying usage rights using Reader Extensions Service is not available. 
* The service does not provide the ability to convert signed or transparent PDF Documents to PDF/A format. 

+++


+++ 3. Document Services: Document Generation APIs (Output Service)

In a single API call or batch, you can use only one template with multiple DATA XML files. Using mutiple templates with multiple data files in a single API call is not supported.

+++

+++ 4. Automated Forms Conversion Service 

The service does not provide meta-model for Automated Forms Conversion Service. You can [download it from Automated Forms Conversion Service documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/aem-forms-automated-conversion-service/using/extending-the-default-meta-model.html?lang=en#default-meta-model).

+++

+++ 5. Forms portal

Support for anonymous use of Forms portal is not available out of the box (OOTB). You can customize the forms portal to enable displaying forms for non-logged in users.

+++


+++ 6. HTML5 Forms (Mobile Forms)

*   The service does not support HTML5 Forms (Mobile Forms). If you render your XDP-based forms as HTML5 Forms, you can continue using the feature on AEM 6.5 Forms.

*   If you have a usecase to capture data offline and synchronizing it the next time you return online, you can continue using the [AEM Forms Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/forms/use-aem-forms-workspace/introduction-html-workspace.html) feature on AEM 6.5 Forms. 

+++


+++ 7. Form Data Model

*   Forms data model supports only HTTP and HTTPs endpoints to submit data. The service does not support Mutual SSL for REST connector and x509 certificate-based authentication for SOAP data sources. 

*   Forms as a Cloud Service allows to use Microsoft Azure Blob, Microsoft Sharepoint, Microsoft OneDrive, and services supporting general CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations as data stores, both Open API specification 2.0 and Open API specification are supported. The service also provides support for JDBC connector.

+++


+++ 8. Developer environment

* A cloud-native environment does not have web console (configuration manager). You can use [[!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service SDK to generate configurations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/deploying/configuring-osgi.html?lang=en#generating-osgi-configurations-using-the-aem-sdk-quickstart) and CI/CD pipeline to [deploy the configuration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/using-cloud-manager/deploy-code.html?lang=en#deployment-process) to your Cloud Service instance.
* Email support only HTTP and HTTPs protocols, by default. [Contact the support team](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/developing/development-guidelines.html#sending-email) to enable ports for sending emails and to enable SMTP protocol for your environment.
* The service does not support converting a Signed PDF or Transparent PDF to another PDF format. Before using your customer bundles with Forms as a Cloud Service, recompile your custom code with the latest version of adobe-aemfd-docmanager* URL convention of localized Adaptive Forms now supports specifying a locale in the URL. New URL convention enables caching localized forms on a Dispatcher or CDN. On Cloud Service environment, use the URL format `http://host:port/content/forms/af/<afName>.<locale>.html` to request a localized version of an Adaptive Form instead of `http://host:port/content/forms/af/afName.html?afAcceptLang=<locale>`. Adobe recommends using Dispatcher or CDN caching. It helps improve rendering speed of prefilled forms 
* Adobe Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service brings many new features and possibilities into your AEM Projects. However, there are some changes required to Adobe Experience Manager Maven projects to be compatible with AEM Cloud Service. At a high-level, AEM requires a separation of content and code into discrete subpackages to respect the split between mutable and immutable content. Use the [Repository Modernizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/moving/refactoring-tools/repo-modernizer.html) tool to restructure existing project packages by separating content and code into discrete packages to be compatible with the project structure defined for Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service.
