For example, in a particular scenario you require a minimalist theme with clean fonts. Liberty theme lets you achieve that look.

## Reference Templates {#reference-templates}


[Templates](/help/forms/themes.md) let you define initial form structure, content, and actions for your forms. You can get the following templates by installing the [Reference content package](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aemcloud.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aemcloud/public/aem-forms-reference-content.ui.content-2.1.0.zip):

* Basic
* Blank

Basic template helps you quickly create an enrollment form. You can also use it to preview functionality of Adaptive Forms foundation components. It provides a wizard layout for section-by-section presentation of data. Use the Blank template to start creating an Adaptive Form from on a blank canvas. 


## Reference Form Data Models {#reference-models}

The Adaptive Forms can then interact with Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Salesforce servers to enable business workflows. For example:

* Write data into Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Salesforce on Adaptive Form submission.
* Write data in Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Salesforce through custom entities defined in Form Data Model and vice versa.
* Query Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Salesforce server for data and prepopulate Adaptive Forms.
* Read data from Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Salesforce server.

You can get the following Form Data Models by installing the [Reference content package](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aemcloud.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aemcloud/public/aem-forms-reference-content.ui.content-2.1.0.zip):
