# Download and Install Forms Designer {#installing-and-configuring-designer}

Designer is a point-and-click graphical form design tool that simplifies the creation of XDP and PDF form templates. You can design a form template, define its logic, and meet strict legislative requirements. An XDP and PDF form serve as a Document of Record template in an Adaptive Form. These forms templates are different from [Adaptive Form templates](template-editor.md).
