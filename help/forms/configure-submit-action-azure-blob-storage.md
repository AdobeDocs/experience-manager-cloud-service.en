# Submit an Adaptive Form to Azure Blob Storage 

The **[!UICONTROL Submit to Azure Blob Storage]**  Submit Action connects an Adaptive Form with a Microsoft&reg; Azure portal. You can submit the form data, files, attachments, or Document of Record to the connected Azure Storage containers. 

AEM as a Cloud Service offers various out of the box submit actions for handling form submissions. You can learn more about these options in the [Adaptive Form Submit Action](/help/forms/configure-submit-actions-core-components.md) article.
