## What's on the dashboard? {#content-of-dashboard}

This dashboard is your window into the world of your form usage. Here's a breakdown of the key sections:

### Form & Documents activity over time

* **Document Renditions**: Track the number of documents rendered over time.
* **Forms Created & Published**: Monitor the rate at which new forms are being built and deployed.
* **Form Creation & Publication Times**: Analyze the average times for creating and publishing forms to identify areas for improvement.

### Fragment Usage

* **Number of Form Fragments in Use**: See how many reusable form sections are currently incorporated into active forms.
* **Form Fragment Re-use**: Gauge how often these fragments are being used across different forms.




## How does this benefit you? {#benefits-to-you}

This dashboard empowers you to make data-driven decisions about your forms. Here's how:

* **Identify Popular Forms**: High submission rates indicate valuable forms. Analyze these for best practices to replicate in others.
