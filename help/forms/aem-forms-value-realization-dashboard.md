# Understanding Your Value Realization Dashboard: Making the Most of Your Forms {#value-realization-dashboard}

Welcome to your one-stop shop for understanding the value your forms are bringing! This dashboard equips you with valuable insights to optimize your forms, streamline workflows, and ultimately achieve your goals faster.

## What's on the Dashboard? {#content-of-dashboard}

This dashboard is your window into the world of your form usage. Here's a breakdown of the key sections:

### Form Activity Over Time (Line Graphs):

* **Form Submissions**: See trends in how often your forms are being completed.
* **Document Renditions**: Track the number of documents rendered over time.
* **Forms Created & Published**: Monitor the rate at which new forms are being built and deployed.
* **Form Creation & Publication Times**: Analyze average times for creating and publishing forms to identify areas for improvement.

### Fragment Usage (Bar Graphs):

* **Number of Form Fragments in Use**: See how many reusable form sections are currently incorporated into active forms.
* **Number of Form Fragment Re-use**: Gauge how often these fragments are being used across different forms.


## How Does This Benefit You? {#benefits-to-you}

This dashboard empowers you to make data-driven decisions about your forms. Here's how:

* **Identify Popular Forms**: High submission rates indicate valuable forms. Analyze these for best practices to replicate in others.
* **Optimize Form Creation**: Reduce creation times by identifying bottlenecks. Explore pre-built templates or streamlining workflows.
* **Boost Fragment Reuse**: Encourage collaboration and discoverability of reusable fragments. Well-organized fragment libraries can significantly improve efficiency.


## Turning Insights into Action {#turning-insights-into-actions}

Let's translate these findings into actionable steps!

* **Low Submissions?** Investigate the form's clarity and user-friendliness. Is it too long or have confusing questions? Consider revising for better user experience.
* **High Creation Times?** Break down the creation process. Are there unnecessary steps or features not being used effectively? Utilize time-saving features like templates.
* **Underutilized Fragments?** Ensure fragments are well-organized, searchable, and easy to understand. Consider promoting fragment usage within your team.

By analyzing these trends, you can build better forms, save time on creation, and leverage reusable components. This translates to a smoother workflow, happier users, and ultimately, a greater return on your investment.


## Additional Tips {#additional-tips}

* **Set Goals:** Determine what you want to achieve with your forms. Is it increased data collection, faster lead generation, or improved customer satisfaction? Knowing your goals will guide your analysis of the dashboard.
* **Regular Review:** Schedule regular check-ins with the dashboard to track progress and identify new areas for improvement.
* **Experiment & Refine:** Don't be afraid to experiment with different form designs and fragment usage. The dashboard will help you measure the effectiveness of your changes.

Remember, this dashboard is your ally! By utilizing it effectively, you can transform your forms from simple data collection tools into strategic assets that drive success for you and your business.
