## What's on the dashboard? {#content-of-dashboard}

This dashboard is your window into the world of your form usage. Here's a breakdown of the key sections:


### Form & Documents activity over time

* **Document Renditions**: Track the number of documents rendered over time.
* **Forms Created & Published**: Monitor the rate at which new forms are being built and deployed.

### Fragment Usage

* **Number of Form Fragments in Use**: See how many reusable form sections are currently incorporated into active forms.
* **Form Fragment Re-use**: Gauge how often these fragments are being used across different forms.

* **Underutilized Fragments?** Ensure that fragments are well-organized, searchable, and easy to understand. Consider promoting fragment usage within your team.

By analyzing these trends, you can build better forms, save time on creation, and leverage reusable components. This translates to a smoother workflow, happier users, and ultimately, a greater return on your investment.
