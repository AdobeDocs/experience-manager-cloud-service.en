    AEM Forms as a Cloud Service - Communications APIs.

    # Introduction

    Communications APIs help you combine XFA-based XDP or PDF templates and Acrobat Forms (AcroForm) with XML data to generate print documents in various formats. It lets you create applications so you can do the following:

    - Generate documents by populating template files with XML data. For example, receipts, bills, and statements.    

    - Generate forms in various formats, including non-interactive PDF print
    streams.

    - Generate print PDFs from XFA form PDFs.

    - Generate PDF, PostScript, PCL, and ZPL documents in bulk by merging
    multiple sets of data with source templates.

    # Before you start

    Make user account of your developer or technical account member of forms-user group. If you do not have a technical account, call AEM as a Cloud Service. When you use service credential, a technical account is created on the first call.

    # Set up Communicaions APIs

    Contact formscsbeta@adobe.com so you can enable Communications APIs for your organization. Send name of your organization, program details, and email address of your AEM as a Cloud Service administrator. Also, set up a [local development environment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/setup-configure-migrate/setup-local-development-environment.html to test and develop the functionality using Communication APIs locally.

      description: |
        In token-based authentication, an access token (Bearer authentication token) is required to make requests to AEM as a Cloud Service.
        AEM Forms as a Cloud Service provides APIs to securely retrieve the access token.
        The end-to-end workflow for retrieving and using the token to authenticate a request is:

        - [Retrieve credentials on AEM as a Cloud Service from the Developer
        Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/authentication/service-credentials.html?lang=en).

        - [Install credentials for AEM as a Cloud Service on your
        environment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/authentication/service-credentials.html?lang=en).
        (Application Server, Web Server, or other non-AEM servers) configured to
        send requests to (make calls) the cloud service.

        - [Generate a JWT token and exchanged it with Adobe IMS APIs for an
        access
        token](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/authentication/service-credentials.html?lang=en#create-a-jwt-and-exchange-for-an-access-token).

        - Run the AEM API with the access token as a Bearer Authentication
        token.

        - [Set appropriate permissions for the technical account user in the AEM
        environment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/authentication/service-credentials.html?lang=en#configure-access-in-aem).
    Basic authentication:
      type: https
      scheme: basic
      description: |
        Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol.
        The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password.
        For example, to authorize as admin / admin the client sends Basic [base64-encoded string username]: [base64-encoded string password].
        For information about retrieving and using token, see [Token-based authentication to AEM as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/authentication/overview.html?lang=en).
