# Connect an Adaptive Form to Microsoft® SharePoint

The **[!UICONTROL Submit to SharePoint]** submit action allows you to seamlessly connect your Adaptive Form with a Microsoft® SharePoint storage. It sends the form data to the SharePoint storage of your choice after you submit the form. 

AEM as a Cloud Service offers various out of the box submit actions for handling form submissions. You can learn more about these options in the [Adaptive Form Submit Action](/help/forms/configure-submit-actions-core-components.md)  article.

## Advantages

Some of the advantages of submitting data from an Adaptive Form to the SharePoint storage are:

* It facilitates the direct submission of form data to SharePoint, providing a centralized location for storing and managing information.
* By applying the SharePoint's access control and permissions features, it ensures that only authorized individuals can view or modify the submitted data.

Using **[!UICONTROL Submit to SharePoint]**, you can:

* [Connect an Adaptive Form to SharePoint Document Library](#connect-af-sharepoint-doc-library)
* [Connect an Adaptive Form to SharePoint List](#connect-af-sharepoint-list)

To connect AEM Forms to your Microsoft&reg; Sharepoint Document Library storage:

1. Go to your **AEM Forms Author** instance > **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Cloud Services]** >  **[!UICONTROL Microsoft&reg; SharePoint]**.
