## Pre-requisite

Before exploring the various capabilities of a layout, ensure that core components are enabled for your environment. For detailed instructions on how to enable core components for your environment, [click here](/help/forms/enable-adaptive-forms-core-components.md).

##  Adaptive Forms layout types

Adaptive Form based on Core Components supports the following types of layouts:
* **Panel layout**
* **Wizard layout**
* **Vertical layout**
* **Horizontal layout**
* **Accordion layout**

>[!TAB Panel Layout]

Panel layout is useful for organizing related fields in a way that makes it easier to navigate and find corresponding content. The panel layout arranges form components within distinct, sections or panels in an Adaptive Form. 

![Panel Layout](/help/forms/assets/panel-layout.png)

Panel Layout

You can use the [panel component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/panel) to add the panel layout in a form. For detailed instructions on how to configure various properties of the panel component, refer to the [panel component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/panel) article.

>[!TAB Wizard Layout]

The wizard layout helps simplifying a complex form by breaking it into distinct steps. Each step represents a different part of the process, and users navigate through the steps sequentially, often with **Next** and **Previous** buttons. You can use the wizard layout to create a form that involves multiple sections or steps.

## How to insert a layout and add form components to it?

The below diagram displays the steps to insert a layout to a form and add form components to it:

![Workflow to add a layout and form components](/help/forms/assets/workflow-to-add-component-to-a-layout.png)

Consider the **IT Request Form** shown in the [Adaptive Forms Layout Types](#adaptive-forms-layout-types) section. The form gathers information from employees experiencing technical issues related to their network or laptop. It includes three panels:

* **Employee Details**: The panel collects information about the employee and contains three textboxes labeled Name, Email ID, and Department.

* **Problem Details**: The panel captures details about the issue. It includes a checkbox for the problem category with three options: Network, Computer, or Other. It also features two textboxes labeled Please Specify and Comments.

* **Attachments**: The panel allows users to upload supporting documents related to the problem. 

Let's explore the step-by-step process for inserting a layout and adding components to it. In this example, a horizontal tabs layout is inserted to a form.

### 1. Insert a layout component to a form

1. Log in to your [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] instance. 
1. In the upper-left corner, select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager]** > **[!UICONTROL Forms]** > **[!UICONTROL Forms & Documents]**.
1. Open an existing Adaptive Form in an edit mode if it has already been created. 

    ![Open an Adaptive Form](/help/forms/assets/insert-layout.png)

    Alternatively, you can also [create new Adaptive Form](/help/forms/creating-adaptive-form-core-components.md).

1. Locate the section within the form editor that allows you to add a layout. 

    ![Form editor](/help/forms/assets/form-editor.png)
1. Click the **Add** icon. The icon is a plus sign (+) that signifies the option to add new components.

    ![Insert layout](/help/forms/assets/insert-layout-add-icon.png)
    
    Clicking the **Add** icon displays an **Insert New Component** dialog box that displays various components for insertion.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Alternatively, you can also [drag and drop the layout component](#extra-bytes).

1. Browse the available components in the dialog box and select the desrired layout from the list. In our case, we select the Horizontal Tabs component to insert the horizontal tabs layout.

    ![Select horizontal tabs](/help/forms/assets/select-horizontal-tab.png)

    When you add the horizontal tabs component to your form, it initially consists of two empty panels, named Item1 and Item2, by default. You need to manually add form components to these panels. 

    ![Horizontal tabs](/help/forms/assets/insert-tabs-on-top.png)

1. Open the properties of the horizontal tabs component and specify the name for the component.
 For example, in this case, we add the name of the horizontal tabs component as IT Request Form.

    ![Add name for Horizontal tabs](/help/forms/assets/change-name-of-horizontal-tabs.png)

1. Click **Done**.

    ![Horizontal tabs](/help/forms/assets/tabs-on-top-rename-component.png)
