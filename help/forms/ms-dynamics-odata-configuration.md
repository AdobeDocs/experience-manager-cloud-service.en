# [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] OData configuration {#microsoft-dynamics-odata-configuration}

 ![data-integeration](assets/data-integeration.png)

[!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software that provides enterprise solutions for creating and managing customer accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, and cases. [[!DNL Experience Manager Forms] Data Integration](data-integration.md) provides an OData cloud service configuration to integrate Forms with both online and on-premises [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] server. It enables you to create Form Data Model based on the entities, attributes, and services defined in [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] service. The Form Data Model can be used to create Adaptive Forms that interact with [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] server to enable business workflows. For example:

* Query [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] server for data and prepopulate Adaptive Forms
* Write data into [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] on Adaptive Form submission
* Write data in [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] through custom entities defined in Form Data Model and vice versa

<!--[!DNL Experience Manager Forms] add-on package also includes reference OData configuration that you can use to quickly integrate [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] with [!DNL Experience Manager Forms].-->

<!--When the package is installed, the following entities and services are available on your [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] instance:

* MS Dynamics OData Cloud Service (OData Service)-->
<!--* Form Data Model with preconfigured [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] entities and services.-->

<!-- Preconfigured [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] entities and services in a Form Data Model are available on your [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] instance only if the run mode for the [!DNL Experience Manager] instance is set as `samplecontent` (default). -->  MS Dynamics OData Cloud Service (OData Service) is available with all run modes. For more information on configuring run modes for an [!DNL Experience Manager] instance, see [Run Modes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/deploying/overview.html#runmodes).

## Create Form Data Model {#create-form-data-model}

<!--When you install the [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] package, a form data model, **[!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] FDM**, is deployed on your [!DNL Experience Manager] instance. By default, the Form Data Model uses [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] service configured in the MS Dynamics OData Cloud Service (OData Service) as its data source.

On opening the Form Data Model for the first time, it connects to the configured [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] service and fetches entities from your [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] instance. The "contact" and "lead" entities from [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] are already added in the form data model.

To review the form data model, go to **[!UICONTROL Form Data Model egrations]**. Select **[!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] FDM** and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** to open the Form Data Model in edit mode. Alternatively, you can open the Form Data Model directly from the following URL:

`https://'[server]:[port]'/aem/fdm/editor.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-fdm/ms-dynamics-fdm`

After configuring MS Dynamics OData Cloud Ser Form Data Model ce) cloud service, you can use the service while creating form data models. For more information, see [Create form data model](create-form-data-models.md).

Next, you can create an Adaptive Form based o Form Data Model odel and use it in various Adaptive Form use cases, such as:

* Prefill Adaptive Form by querying information from [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] entities and services
* Invoke [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] server operations defined in a Form Data Model using Adaptive Form rules
* Write submitted form data to [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] entities

<!--It is recommended to create a copy of the Form Data Model provided with the [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] package and configure data models and services to suit your requirements. It will ensure that any future updates to the package do not override your form data model.-->

For more information about creating and using Form Data Model in business workflows, see [Data Integration](data-integration.md).
