**[!UICONTROL Footnote]** is the extra bit of information or notes which appear at the end of the page. [!UICONTROL Footnote] comprises the notes that are indicated in your text with numbers as a superscript.

Footnotes are numbered sequentially in the order that they appear on the page. Each footnote has a unique number as a superscript which corresponds to the number which is placed at the bottom of the page. Next to the number appears the supplementary information as a footnote description.
