# Supported fonts for Interactive Communications and Document of Record

AEM Forms offers various built-in fonts that can be seamlessly used within Document of Record and PDF files.

You can use Forms as a Cloud Service Communications to combine various types of files, such as XDP templates or PDFs, with XML data to generate PDF documents. You can manipulate the PDFs by combining, rearranging, or merging PDF or XDP files. You can also use the Document of Record to archive AEM forms and content together in PDF format. Additionally, you can use supported fonts or custom fonts to give the PDFs a specific look and feel.
