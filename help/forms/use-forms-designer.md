# Use Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms Designer {#install-designer}

Designer is a point-and-click graphical form design tool that simplifies the creation of XDP form templates. You can design a form template, define its logic, and meet strict legislative requirements. These templates serve as a Document of Record template for an Adaptive Form. These forms templates are different from [Adaptive Form templates](template-editor.md). 

The following documents provide instructions to use Designer to create XDP templates and PDF forms:
