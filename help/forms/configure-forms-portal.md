# List Adaptive Forms on a Portal {#publish-forms-on-portal}

In a typical forms-centric portal deployment scenario, forms development and portal development are two disjoint activities. While Form Designers design and store forms in a repository, Web Developers create a web application to list forms and handle submission of forms. Forms are copied over to the web tier as there is no communication between the forms repository and the web application.

Such scenarios often result in management issues and production delays. For example, if there is a newer version of a form available in the repository, you need to replace the form on the web tier, modify the web application, and redeploy the form on the public site. Redeploying the web application might cause some server downtime. Typically, the server downtime is a planned activity and therefore the changes cannot be pushed to the public site instantaneously.

AEM Forms provide portal components that reduce management overheads and production delays. The components equip Web Developers to create and customize a Forms Portal on websites authored using Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

The Form Portal components allow you to add the following functionality:

* List forms in customized layouts. Out of the box, List view and Card view layouts are provided. You can create your own custom layouts.
* Enables you to display custom metadata and custom actions while listing them.
* List forms published by AEM Forms UI on the publish instance where Forms Portal components are being used.
* Allow end users to render forms in HTML and PDF format.
* Enable searching of forms based on title and description.
* Use custom CSS to customize the look and feel of the portal.
* Create links to forms.
* Lists drafts and submissions related to Adaptive Forms created by the end user.

## Components of a Forms Portal Page {#forms-portal-components}

AEM Forms provide the following portal components out of the box:

* Search & Lister: This component allows you to list forms from the forms repository onto your portal page and provides configuration options to list forms based on specified criteria.

* Drafts & Submissions: While Search & Lister component displays forms which are made public by Forms author, the Drafts & Submissions component displays forms that are saved as draft for completing later and submitted forms. This component provides personalized experience to any logged in user.

* Link: This component allows you to create a link to a form anywhere on the page.

You can [import the out-of-the-box Forms Portal components](#import-forms-portal-components-aem-archetype) from the AEM Project Archetype. After importing, perform the following configurations: 
* [Configure an external storage](#configure-azure-storage-adaptive-forms)
* [Enable the Forms Portal components](#enable-forms-portal-components) 
* [Configure the Forms Portal components](#configure-forms-portal-components)

## Import Forms Portal Components {#import-forms-portal-components-aem-archetype}

To import out-of-the-box Forms Portal components on AEM Forms as a Cloud Service, perform the following steps:

1. **Clone Cloud Manager Git repository on your local development instance:**  Your Cloud Manager Git repository contains a default AEM project. It is based on [AEM Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/). Clone your Cloud Manager Git Repository using Self-Service Git Account Management from Cloud Manager UI to bring the project on your local development environment. For details on accessing the repository, see [Accessing Repositories](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/managing-code/accessing-repos.html).  

1.  **Create [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [Cloud Service] project:** Create [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [Cloud Service] project based on [AEM Archetype 27](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/releases/tag/aem-project-archetype-27) or later. The archetype help developers easily start developing for [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service. It also includes some sample themes and templates to help you started quickly.

    To create [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a Cloud Service project, open the command prompt and run the below command. To include [!DNL Forms] specific configurations, themes, and templates, set `includeForms=y`.  

    ```shell
    mvn -B archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.adobe.aem -DarchetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=30 -DaemVersion="cloud" -DappTitle="My Site" -DappId="mysite" -DgroupId="com.mysite" -DincludeForms="y"
    ```

    Also, change `appTitle`, `appId`, and `groupId`, in the above command to reflect your environment.

    After the project is ready, update the `<core.forms.components.version>x.y.z</core.forms.components.version>` property in the top-level `pom.xml` of the Archetype project to reflect the latest version of [core-forms-components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components) in your `AEM Archetype` project. 
 
1. **Deploy the project to your local development environment:** You can use the following command to deploy to your local development environment

    `mvn -PautoInstallPackage clean install`
