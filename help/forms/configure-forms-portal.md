Forms Portal provides an efficient way to display and list Adaptive Forms on an AEM Sites page. It is useful for organizations that require a platform to systematically present various forms to their users.

For example, consider a scenario where a bank needs to display various forms on its website. The bank organizes forms such as loan application forms, account opening forms, and feedback survey forms on the website and uses the Forms Portal to dynamically list them. The Forms Portal enables users to list and search for forms on the bank's website. Anonymous users can view and browse the list of available forms, but to access draft versions or submit completed forms, they need to be logged in. Additionally, the Forms Portal is also used to add reference links to forms on an AEM Sites page

The Form Portal components provides the following functionality:

* List forms in customized layouts. Out of the box, List view and Card view layouts are provided. 
* Enable searching of forms based on title and description.
* Create links to forms for easy access and sharing.
* Lists drafts and submissions created by the user.
