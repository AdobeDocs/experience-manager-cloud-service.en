# Connect an Adaptive Form to Microsoft® SharePoint List 

<span class="preview"> This is a pre-release feature and accessible through our [pre-release channel](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/release-notes/prerelease.html#new-features). </span>

**Microsoft® SharePoint**: Microsoft® SharePoint enables collaboration by providing dynamic and efficient team sites for all teams, departments, and divisions. It is used to store, organize, share, and access information from any device using any web browser, for example, Microsoft® Edge, Internet Explorer, Chrome, or Firefox. The two main components of **Microsoft® SharePoint** are:

* **Microsoft® SharePoint Document Library**: Microsoft® SharePoint Document Library displays a list of files and folders along with their key information, such as the last modified date and the owner of a file. This feature makes the organization and navigation of files easy.
For instructions on how to integrate a **Microsoft® SharePoint Document Library** with an Adaptive Form, see the [Adaptive Form Submit Action](/help/forms/configuring-submit-actions.md#submit-to-sharepoint) article.

* **Microsoft® SharePoint List**: Microsoft® SharePoint List is a collection of data. You can add columns for different types of data and create views to display data effectively. You can group, filter, sort, and format the lists easily.

* [Configure Rule Editor to invoke a Form Data Model](/help/forms/rule-editor.md#invoke-form-data-model-service-invoke)

## Connect Microsoft® SharePoint List to an AEM workflow {#connect-sharepoint-list-workflow}

To integrate Microsoft® SharePoint List to an AEM Workflow:

1. [Create a workflow to invoke a Form Data model](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/developing/extending-aem/extending-workflows/workflows-models.html)

    <!--
    To create a new workflow with the editor, perform the following steps:
