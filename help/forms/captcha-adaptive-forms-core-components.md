CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a program commonly used in online transactions to distinguish between humans and automated programs or bots. It poses a challenge and evaluates user response to determine if it's a human or a bot interacting with the site. It prevents the user to proceed if the test fails and helps make online transactions secure by keeping bots from posting spam or malicious purposes.

AEM Forms as a Cloud Service supports the following CAPTCHA solutions: 

* [Google reCAPTCHA](#connect-your-aem-forms-environment-with-recaptcha-service-by-google)
* [Cloudflare Turnstile](/help/forms/integrate-adaptive-forms-turnstile-core-components.md)
* [hCaptcha](/help/forms/integrate-adaptive-forms-hcaptcha-core-components.md)  


## Connect your AEM Forms Core Components with reCAPTCHA service by Google {#connect-your-forms-environment-with-recaptcha-service-by-google}

Form authors can use the reCAPTCHA service by Google to implement reCAPTCHA in Adaptive Forms. It offers advance CAPTCHA capabilities to protect your site. For more information on how reCAPTCHA works, see [Google reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/). You use it to present a CAPTCHA challenge on form submission.[!DNL AEM Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] supports Google reCAPTCHA v2 and reCAPTCHA Enterprise. Any other version is not supported. Also notice, reCAPTCHA in Adaptive Forms is not supported in offline mode on AEM Forms app.
  
Based on your requirement you can configure reCAPTCHA service to enable:

* [reCAPTCHA Enterprise](#steps-to-implement-reCAPTCHA-enterprise-in-forms-core-components)
* [reCAPTCHA v2](#steps-to-implement-reCAPTCHA-v2-in-forms)

### Configure reCAPTCHA Enterprise  {#steps-to-implement-reCAPTCHA-enterprise-in-forms-core-components}

1. Create or select a [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/set-up-non-google-cloud-environments-api-keys#before-you-begin) and enable [reCAPTCHA Enterprise API](https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/set-up-non-google-cloud-environments-api-keys#enable-the-recaptcha-enterprise-api).

            >[!NOTE] 
            >
            >* In the cloud configuration with **key type** as **checkbox**, the customized error message appears as an inline message if the captcha validation fails.
            >* In the cloud configuration with **key type** as **score based**,  the customized error message shows as a pop-up message if the captcha validation fails.
        1. You can select size as **[!UICONTROL Normal]** and **[!UICONTROL Compact]**.

        >[!NOTE] 
        >* You can have multiple Cloud Configurations in your environment for similar purpose. So, choose the service carefully. If no service is listed, see [Connect your AEM Forms environment with reCAPTCHA service by Google](#connect-your-forms-environment-with-recaptcha-service-by-google) to learn how to create a Cloud Service that connects your AEM Forms environment with reCAPTCHA service by Google.

    * **Captcha Size:** You can select the display size of Google reCAPTCHA challenge dialog. Use the **[!UICONTROL Compact]** option to display a small sized and the **[!UICONTROL Normal]** option to display a relatively large-size Google reCAPTCHA challenge dialog.
