# Forms-centric AEM Workflows - Step Reference {#forms-centric-workflow-on-osgi-step-reference}

You use workflow models to convert a business logic to automated repetitive process. A model helps you define and execute a series of steps. You can also define model properties, such as whether the workflow is transient or uses multiple resources. You can [include various AEM Workflow steps in a model to achieve the business logic](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/developing/extending-aem/extending-workflows/workflows-models.html?lang=en#extending-aem).  

## Forms-centric steps {#forms-workflow-steps}

Forms-centric workflow steps perform AEM Forms-specific operations in an AEM Workflow. These steps allow you to rapidly build Adaptive Forms based Forms-centric workflow on OSGi. These workflows can be used for developing basic review- and approval-workflows, internal and across- the-firewall business processes. You can also use Forms Workflow steps to:

* Create business processes, post-submission workflows, and backend workflows to manage enrollment processes.

* Create and assign tasks to a user or group.

* Use [!DNL Adobe Sign] in an AEM Workflow to send a document for  signing.

* Generate a Document of Record on-demand or on form submission.

* Connect a workflow model with various data sources to easily save and retrieve data.

* Use the email step to send notification emails and other attachments on completion of an action and at the start or completion of a  workflow.


## Assign task step {#assign-task-step}

The assign task step creates a work item and assigns it to a user or group. Along with assigning the task, the component also specifies the Adaptive Form or non-interactive PDF for the task. The Adaptive Form is required to accept input from users and non-interactive PDF or a read-only Adaptive Form is used for review only workflows.

You can also use the component to control the behavior of the task. For example, creating an automatic Document of Record, assigning the task to a specific user or group, specifying the path of the submitted data, specifying the path of data to be pre-populated, and specifying default actions. The Assign Task step has the following properties:

* **[!UICONTROL Title]**: Title of the task. The title is displayed in AEM Inbox.
* **[!UICONTROL Description]**: Explanation of the operations being performed in the task. This information is useful for other process developers when you are working in a shared development environment.  

* **[!UICONTROL Thumbnail Path]**: Path of the task thumbnail. If no path is specified, for an Adaptive Form default thumbnail is displayed and for Document of Record, a default icon is displayed.
* **[!UICONTROL Workflow Stage]**: A workflow can have multiple stages. These stages are displayed in the AEM Inbox. You can define these stages in the properties of the model (Sidekick &gt; Page &gt; Page Properties &gt; Stages).
* **[!UICONTROL Priority]**: Selected priority is displayed in the AEM Inbox. The available options are High, Medium, and Low. The default value is Medium.
* **[!UICONTROL Due Date]**: Specify the number of days or hours after which the task is marked overdue. If you select **[!UICONTROL Off]**, then the task is never marked overdue. You can also specify a time-out handler to perform specific tasks after the task is overdue.

* **[!UICONTROL Days]**: The number of days before which the task is to be completed. The number of days are counted after the task is assigned to a user. If a task is not complete and crosses the number of days specifies in the Days field, then, if selected, a timeout handler is triggered after the due date.
* **[!UICONTROL Hours]**: The number of hours before which the task is to be completed. The number of hours are counted after the task is assigned to a user. If a task is not complete and crosses the number of hours specifies in the Hours field, then, if selected, a timeout handler is triggered after the due hours.
* **[!UICONTROL Time-out after Due Date]**: Select this option to enable the Timeout Handler selection field.
* **[!UICONTROL Timeout Handler]**: Select the script to be executed when the assign task step crosses the due date. Scripts placed in the CRX-repository at [apps]/fd/dashboard/scripts/timeoutHandler are available for selection. The specified path does not exist in crx-repository. An administrator creates the path before using it.
* **[!UICONTROL Highlight the action and comment from the last task in Task Details]**: Select this option to display the last action that was taken and comment received on the task details section of a task.
* **[!UICONTROL Type]**: Choose the type of document to be filled when the workflow is started. You can choose an Adaptive Form, read-only Adaptive Form, a non-interactive PDF document. <!-- , Interactive Communication Agent UI, or Interactive Communication Web Channel Document. -->
* **[!UICONTROL Use Adaptive Form]**: Specify the method to locate the input Adaptive Form. This option is available if you select Adaptive Form or Read-only Adaptive Form from the Type drop-down list. You can use the Adaptive Form submitted to the workflow, available at an absolute path, or available at a path in a variable. You can use a variable of type String to specify the path.  
  You can associate multiple Adaptive Forms with a workflow. As a result, you can specify an Adaptive Form on the runtime using the available input methods.

<!-- 
* **[!UICONTROL Use Interactive Communication]**: Specify the method to locate the input interactive communication. You can use the interactive communication submitted to the workflow, available at an absolute path, or available at a path in a variable. You can use a variable of type String to specify the path. This option is available if you select Interactive Communication Agent UI or Interactive Communication Web Channel Document from the Type drop-down list. 

> [!NOTE]
>
>You must have cm-agent-users and workflow-users group assignments to access Interactive Communications Agent UI in AEM inbox.  --> 

* **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Path]**: Specify the path of the Adaptive Form.<!--  or Interactive Communication.--> You can use the Adaptive Form <!-- or interactive communication --> that is submitted to the workflow, available at an absolute path, or retrieve the Adaptive Form from a path stored in a variable of string data type.
* **[!UICONTROL Select input PDF using]**: Specify the path of a non-interactive PDF document. The field is available when you choose a non-interactive PDF document in the Type field. You can select the input PDF using the path that is relative to the payload, saved at an absolute path, or using a variable of Document data type. For example, [Payload_Directory]/Workflow/PDF/credit-card.pdf. The path does not exist in crx-repository. An administrator creates the path before using it. You require a Document of Record option enabled or form template based Adaptive Forms for using the PDF Path option.
* **[!UICONTROL For completed task, render the Adaptive Form as]**: When a task is marked complete, you can render the Adaptive Form as a read-only Adaptive Form or a PDF document. You require a Document of Record option enabled or form template based Adaptive Forms for rendering the Adaptive Form as Document of Record.
* **[!UICONTROL Pre-populated]**: The following fields listed below serve as inputs to the task:

    * **[!UICONTROL Select input data file using]**: Path of input data file (.json, .xml, .doc, or form data model). You can retrieve the input data file using a path that is relative to the payload or retrieve the file stored in a variable of Document, XML, or JSON data type. For example, the file contains the data submitted for the form through an AEM Inbox application. An example path is [Payload_Directory]/workflow/data.
    * **[!UICONTROL Select input attachments using]**: Attachments available at the location are attached to the form associated with the task. The path is always relative to the payload. An example path is [Payload_Directory]/attachments/. You can specify attachments placed relative to the payload or use a document type (Array list > Document) variable to specify an input attachment for the Adaptive Form
    
    <!-- * **[!UICONTROL Choose input JSON]**: Select an input JSON file using a path that is relative to payload or stored in a variable of Document, JSON, or Form Data Model data type.

    * **[!UICONTROL Request Attribute Mapping]**: Use the Request Attribute Mapping section to define the [name and value of the request attribute](work-with-form-data-model.md#bindargument). Retrieve the details from the data source based on the attribute name and value specified in the request. You can define a request attribute value using a literal value or a variable of String data type.  
     <!--  The prefill service and request attribute mapping options are available only if you select Interactive Communication Agent UI or Interactive Communication Web Channel Document from the Type drop-down list. -->

* **[!UICONTROL Submitted information]**: The following fields listed below serve as output locations to the task:

    * **[!UICONTROL Save output data file using]**: Save the data file (.json, .xml, .doc, or form data model). The data file contains information submitted through the associated form. You can save the output data file using a path that is relative to the payload or store it in a variable of Document, XML, or JSON data type. For example, [Payload_Directory]/Workflow/data, where data is a file.
    * **[!UICONTROL Save attachments using]**: Save the form attachments provide in a task. You can save the attachments using a path that is relative to the payload or store it in a variable of array list of Document data type.
    * **[!UICONTROL Save Document of Record using]**: Path to save a Document of Record file. For example, [Payload_Directory]/DocumentofRecord/credit-card.pdf. You can save the Document of Record using a path that is relative to the payload or store it in a variable of Document data type. If you select **[!UICONTROL Relative to Payload]** option, The Document of Record is not generated if the path field is left empty. This option is available only if you select Adaptive Form from the Type drop-down list.
    
    <!-- * **[!UICONTROL Save Web Channel data using]**: Save the Web Channel data file using a path that is relative to the payload or store it in a variable of Document, JSON, or Form Data Model data type.

You are allowed to delegate within the same group or to the workflow user of another group. If the task is assigned to a single user and the **[!UICONTROL allow delegation to members of the assignee group]** option is selected, then it is not possible to delegate the task to another user or group.
* **[!UICONTROL Share Settings]**: AEM Inbox provides options to share a single or all the tasks in the inbox with another users:
    * When the **[!UICONTROL Allow assignee to share explicitly in inbox]** option is selected, the user can select the task in AEM Inbox and share it with another AEM user. 
    * When the **[!UICONTROL Allow assignee to share via inbox sharing]** option is selected and users share their Inbox items or allows other users to access their Inbox items, only tasks with previously mentioned option enabled are shared with other users.
    * When the **[!UICONTROL Allow assignee to delegate using 'Out of Office' settings]** is selected. The assignee can enable the option to delegate the task to other users along with other Out of Office options. Any new tasks assigned to the out-of-office user are automatically delegated (assigned) to the users mentioned in out-of-office settings.
    
     It allows other users to pick assignees tasks while is out of office and unable to work on assigned tasks. 

* **[!UICONTROL Actions]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Default Actions]**: Out of the box, Submit, Save, and Reset actions are available. All the default actions are enabled, by default.

## Send Email Step {#send-email-step}

Use the email step to send an email, for example an email with a Document of Record, link of an Adaptive Form <!-- , link of an interactive communication-->, or with an attached PDF document. Send Email step supports [HTML email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_email). HTML emails are responsive and adapt to the recipients' email client and screen size. You can use an HTML email template to define appearance, color-scheme, and behavior of the email.

The email step uses Day CQ Mail Service to send emails. Before using the email step, ensure that the email service is configured. Email support only HTTP and HTTPs protocols, by default. [Contact the support team](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/developing/development-guidelines.html?lang=en#sending-email) to enable ports for sending emails and to enable SMTP protocol for your environment. The restriction helps improve security of the platform.

The email step has the following properties:

**[!UICONTROL Title]**: Title of the step helps identify the step in the workflow editor.

**[!UICONTROL Description]**: Explanation is useful for other process developers when you are working in a shared development environment.

**[!UICONTROL Email Subject]**: Subject can be retrieved from a workflow metadata, specified manually, or retrieved from the value stored in a variable. Select from the following options:

* **[!UICONTROL Literal]** Manually specify a subject.
* **[!UICONTROL Retrieve from Workflow metadata]** - Retrieve the subject from a metadata property.
* **[!UICONTROL Variable]** - Retrieve the subject from the value stored in a variable of string data type.

**[!UICONTROL HTML Email Template]**: HTML template for the email. You can specify variables in an email template. The Email Step extracts and displays all the variables included in a template for inputs.

**[!UICONTROL Email Template Metadata]**: Value of the email template variables can be a user-specified value, the path of an asset on the author or the publish server, image, or a workflow metadata property.

* **[!UICONTROL Literal]**: Use the option when you know the exact value to specify. For example, [example@example.com](mailto:example@example.com).

* **[!UICONTROL Workflow Metadata]**: Use the option when the value to use is saved in a workflow metadata property. After selecting the option, enter the metadata property name in the empty text box below the Workflow Metadata option. For example, emailAddress.
<!-- * **[!UICONTROL Asset URL]**: Use the option to embed a web link of an interactive communication to the email. After selecting the option, browse and choose the interactive communication to embed. The asset can reside on the author or the publish server. -->
* **[!UICONTROL Image]**: Use the option to embed an image to the email. After selecting the option, browse and choose the image. The image option is available only for the image tags (&lt;img src="&#42;"/&gt;) available in the email template.

**[!UICONTROL Sender’s / Recipient's Email Address]**: Select the **[!UICONTROL Literal]** option to manually specify an email address or select the **[!UICONTROL Retrieve from Workflow metadata]** option to retrieve the email address from a metadata property. You can also specify a list of metadata property arrays for the **[!UICONTROL Retrieve from Workflow metadata]** option. Select the **[!UICONTROL Variable]** option to retrieve the e-mail address from the value stored in a variable of string data type.

* **[!UICONTROL File Attachment]**: The asset available at the specified location is attached to the email. The path of the asset can be relative to the payload or absolute path. An example path is [Payload_Directory]/attachments/.

Select the **[!UICONTROL Variable]** option to retrieve the file attachment stored in a variable of Document, XML, or JSON data type.

**[!UICONTROL File Name]**: Name of the email attachment file. The Email Step changes the original file name of the attachment to the specified file name. The name can be specified manually or retrieved from a workflow metadata property or a variable. Use the **[!UICONTROL Literal]** option when you know the exact value to specify. Use the **[!UICONTROL Variable]** option to retrieve the file name from the value stored in a variable of string data type. Use the **[!UICONTROL Retrieve from a Workflow Metadata]** option when the value to use is saved in a workflow metadata property.

## Generate Document of Record step {#generate-document-of-record-step}

When a form is filled or submitted, you can keep a record of the form, in print or in document format. This record is referred as a Document of Record (DoR). You can use the Generate Document of Record step to create a read-only or interactive PDF version of an Adaptive Form. The PDF version contains information filled-in to the form along with the layout of the Adaptive Form.

The Document of Record step has the following properties:

**[!UICONTROL Use Adaptive Form]**: Specify the method to locate the input Adaptive Form. You can use the Adaptive Form submitted to the workflow, available at an absolute path, or available at a path in a variable. You can use a variable of String data type to specify the path in the **[!UICONTROL Select variable to resolve]** field.  
You can associate multiple Adaptive Forms with a workflow. As a result, you can specify an Adaptive Form on the runtime using the available input methods.

**[!UICONTROL Adaptive Form Path]**: Specify the path of the Adaptive Form. The field is available when you select the **[!UICONTROL Available at an absolute path]** option from the **[!UICONTROL Use Adaptive Form]** field.

**[!UICONTROL Select Input data using]**: Path of the input data for the Adaptive Form. You can keep the data at a location relative to the payload, specify an absolute path of the data, or retrieve data stored in a variable of Document, JSON, or XML data type. The input data is merged with the Adaptive Form to create a Document of Record.

**[!UICONTROL Select Input attachment path using]**: Path of the attachments. These attachments are included in the Document of Record. You can keep the attachments at a location relative to the payload, specify an absolute path of the attachments, or retrieve attachments stored in a variable of array of Document data type.

If you specify the path of a folder, for example, attachments, all the files directly available in the folder are attached to Document of Record. If any files are available in the folders directly available in the specified attachment path, the files are included in Document of Record as attachments. If there are any folders in directly available folders, those folders are skipped.

**[!UICONTROL Save Generated Document of Record using below options]**: Specify the location to keep a Document of Record file. You can choose to overwrite the payload folder, place Document of Record at a location within the payload directory, or store the Document of Record in a variable of Document data type.

**[!UICONTROL Locale]**: Specify the language of the Document of Record. Select **[!UICONTROL Literal]** to select the locale from a drop-down list or select **[!UICONTROL Variable]** to retrieve the locale from the value stored in a variable of string data type. You must define the locale code while storing the value for the locale in a variable. For example, specify **en_US** for English and **fr_FR** for French.

## Invoke Form Data Model Service step {#invoke-form-data-model-service-step}

You can use [[!DNL AEM Forms] Data Integration](data-integration.md) to configure and connect to disparate data sources. These data sources can be a web service, REST service, OData service, and CRM solution. [!DNL AEM Forms] Data Integration allows you to create a Form Data Model encompassing various services to perform data retrieval, addition, updating operations on the configured database. You can use the **[!UICONTROL Invoke Data Model Service step]** to select a Form Data Model (FDM) and use the services of the FDM to retrieve, update, or add data to disparate data sources.

To explain inputs for fields of the step, the following database table and JSON file are used as an example :

**[!UICONTROL Sample CustomerDetails table]**

<table>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Property</td> 
   <td>Value<br /> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>FirstName<br /> </td> 
   <td>Sarah<br /> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>LastName</td> 
   <td>Rose</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Customer ID</td> 
   <td>1</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Email Address<br /> </td> 
   <td>srose@we.info</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

**[!UICONTROL Sample JSON file]**

```json
  { 
    customer: { 
     firstName: "Sarah", 
     lastName:"Rose", 
     customerId: "1", 
     emailAddress:"srose@we.info" 
   }, 
    insurance: {
     customerId: "1", 
    policyType: "Premium,
    policyNumber: "Premium-521499",
    customerDetails: { 
     firstName: "Sarah",
     lastName: "Rose",
     customerId: "1",
     emailAddress: "srose@we.info" 
    }
   }
  }

You can also retrieve the input JSON document using a variable of JSON or Form Data Model data type.

* **[!UICONTROL JSON Dot Notation]**: Leave the field blank to use all the objects of the specified JSON file as input for service arguments. To read a specific JSON object from the specified JSON file as input for service arguments, specify dot notation for the JSON object, for example, If you have a JSON similar to the one listed at the start of the section, specify insurance.customerDetails to provide all the details of a customer as input to the service.
* **[!UICONTROL Output of service]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Map and write output values to variable or metadata]**: Select the option to save the output values as properties of the workflow instance metadata node in crx-repository. Specify the name of the metadata property and select the corresponding service output attribute to be mapped with metadata property, for example, map the phone_number returned by output service with the phone_number property of workflow metadata. Similarly, you can store the output in a variable of Long data type. When you select a property for the **[!UICONTROL Service output attribute to be mapped]** option, only variables capable of storing data of the selected property are populated for the **[!UICONTROL Save the output to]** option.

* **[!UICONTROL Output of service]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Save output to variable or a JSON file]**: Select the option to save the output values in a JSON file at an absolute path, at a path relative to payload, or in a variable . 
* **[!UICONTROL Save Output JSON document using below options]**: Save the output JSON file. The path of the output JSON file can be relative to the payload or an absolute path. You can also save the output JSON file using a variable of JSON or Form Data Model data type.

## Sign Document step {#sign-document-step}

The Sign Document step enables you to use [!DNL Adobe Sign] to sign documents. When you use [!DNL Adobe Sign] Workflow step to Sign an Adaptive Form, the form can be passed across signers one after another or can be sent to all the signers simultaneously, depending on the configuration of workflow step. [!DNL Adobe Sign] enabled Adaptive Forms are submitted to Experience Manager Forms Server only after all the signers complete the signing process.

By default, the [!DNL Adobe Sign] Scheduler services checks (polls) signer response after every 24 hours. You can [change the default interval for your environment](adobe-sign-integration-adaptive-forms.md##configure-adobe-sign-scheduler-to-sync-the-signing-status).

 The Sign Document step has the following properties:

* **[!UICONTROL Agreement Name]**: Specify the title of the agreement. The agreement name becomes part of the subject and body text of the email sent to the signers. You can either store the name in a variable of String data type or select **[!UICONTROL Literal]** to add the name manually.

* **[!UICONTROL Locale]**: Specify the language for the email and verification options. You can either store the locale in a variable of String data type or select **[!UICONTROL Literal]** to choose the locale from the list of available options. You must define the locale code while storing the value for the locale in a variable. For example, specify **[!UICONTROL en_US]** for English and **[!UICONTROL fr_FR]** for French.

* **[!UICONTROL Adobe Sign Cloud Configuration]**: Choose an [!DNL Adobe Sign] Cloud Configuration. If you have not configured [!DNL Adobe Sign] for [!DNL AEM Forms], see [Integrate Adobe Sign with [!DNL AEM Forms]](adobe-sign-integration-adaptive-forms.md). 

* **[!UICONTROL Select Document to be signed using]**: You can choose a document from a location relative to the payload, use payload as the document, specify an absolute path of the document, or retrieve the document stored in a variable of Document data type.
* **[!UICONTROL Days Until Deadline]**: A document is marked due (passed deadline) after there is no activity on the task for the number of days specifies in the **[!UICONTROL Days Until Deadline]** field. The number of days are counted after the documented is assigned to a user for signing.
* **[!UICONTROL Reminder Email Frequency]**: You can send a reminder email at daily or weekly interval. The week is counted from the day the documented is assigned to a user for signing.
* **[!UICONTROL Signature Process]**: You can choose to sign a document in a sequential or a parallel order. In sequential order, one signer receives the document at a time for signing. After the first signer completes signing the document, then the document is sent to the second signer, and so on. In parallel order, multiple signers can sign a document at a time.  
* **[!UICONTROL Redirection URL]**: Specify a redirection URL. After the document is signed, you can redirect the assignee to a URL. Usually, this URL contains a thank you message or further instructions.
* **[!UICONTROL Workflow Stage]**: A workflow can have multiple stages. These stages are displayed in the AEM Inbox. You can define these stages in the properties of the model ( **[!UICONTROL Sidekick]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Page]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Page Properties]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Stages]**).
* **[!UICONTROL Select Signers]**: Specify the method to choose signers for the document. You can dynamically assign the workflow to a user or a group or manually add details of a signer.
* **[!UICONTROL Script or service to select signers]**: The option is available only if the Dynamically option is selected in the Select Signers field. You can specify an ECMAScript or a service to choose signers and verification options for a document.  
* **[!UICONTROL Signer Details]**:  The option is available only if the Manually option is selected in the Select Signers field. Specify email address and choose an optional verification mechanism. Before selecting a 2-step verification mechanism, ensure that the corresponding verification option is enabled for the configured [!DNL Adobe Sign] account. You can use a variable of String data type to define values for Email, Country Code, and Phone Number fields. The Country Code and Phone Number fields display only if you select Phone Verification from the 2-step verification drop-down list.

<!-- ## Document Services steps {#document-services-steps}

AEM Document services are a set of services for creating, assembling, and securing PDF Documents. [!DNL AEM Forms] provides a separate AEM Workflow step for each document service.

Similar to other [!DNL AEM Forms] workflow steps, such as Assign Task, Send Email, and Sign Document, you can use variables in all AEM Document services steps. For more information on creating and managing variables, see [Variables in AEM workflows](variable-in-aem-workflows.md).

### Apply Document Time Stamp step {#apply-document-time-stamp-step}

Add time stamp to a document. You provide document details such as input document path, input document name, location to store exported data. You may choose to overwrite existing payload file, choose a different file name to store data in a different file under payload folder, provide an absolute path to the data, or store data in a variable of Document data type.

### Convert to image step {#convert-to-image-step}

Converts a PDF document to list of images. Supported image formats are JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG, and TIFF. The following information applies to conversions to TIFF images:

* A multi-page TIFF file is generated.
* Some annotations are not included in TIFF images. Annotations that require Acrobat to generate their appearance are not included.

### Convert to PDF/A step {#convert-to-pdf-a-step}

Converts a PDF document to PDF/A format using the options provided. The PDF/A version of Portable Document Format (PDF) is specialized for archiving and long-term preservation of documents.

### Convert to PS step {#convert-to-ps-step}

Convert PDF documents to PostScript. When converting to PostScript, you can use the conversion operation to specify the source document and whether to convert to PostScript level 2 or 3. The PDF document you convert to a PostScript file must be non-interactive.

### Create PDF from specified type step {#create-pdf-from-specified-type-step}

Generate a PDF document from an input file. The input document can be relative to the payload, have an absolute path, can be payload itself, or stored in a variable of Document data type.

### Create PDF from URL/HTML/ZIP step {#create-pdf-from-url-html-zip-step}

Generates a PDF document from supplied URL, HTML, and ZIP file.

### Export Data step {#export-data-step}

Exports data from a PDF forms or XDP file. It requires you to enter the file path of Input Document and the Export Data Format. The options for Export Data Format are Auto, XDP and XmlData.

### Export PDF to specified type step {#export-pdf-to-specified-type-step}

Converts a PDF document to a selected format.

### Generate Non-Interactive PDF step {#generatenoninteractive}

Generate a Non-Interactive PDF. It provides various customization options.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can use variables to specify the template file for input documents. Store the path of the template file in a variable of String data type.

### Import Data step {#import-data-step}

Merges form data into a PDF form. You can import form data into a PDF form.

### Invoke DDX step {#invokeddx}

Executes the DDX file on the specified map of input documents and returns the manipulated PDF documents.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can use variables to specify the DDX file for input documents. Store the DDX file in a variable of Document or XML data type.

### Optimize PDF step {#optimize-pdf-step}

Optimizes PDF files by reducing their size. The result of this conversion is PDF files that may be smaller than their original versions. This operation also converts PDF documents to the PDF version specified in the optimization parameters.

Optimization settings specify how files are optimized. Here are example settings:

* Target PDF version
* Discarding objects such as JavaScript actions and embedded page thumbnails
* Discarding user data such as comments and file attachments
* Discarding invalid or unused settings
* Compressing uncompressed data or using more efficient compression algorithms
* Removing embedded fonts
* Setting transparency values

### Render PDF Form step {#renderpdf}

Renders a form created in Form Designer (XDP) to a PDF form.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can use variables to specify the template file for input documents. Store the path of the template file in a variable of String data type.

### Secure Document step {#secure-document-step}

Encrypt, Sign, and certify a document. [!DNL AEM Forms] supports both password based and certificate base encryption. You can also choose between various algorithms for signing documents. For example, SHA-256 and SH-512. You can also use the workflow step to reader extend PDF documents. The workflow step provides option to enable barcode decoding, digital signatures, import and export of PDF data, and other options.

### Send to Printer step {#send-to-printer-step}

Send a document directly to a printer. It supports the following printing access mechanisms:

* **[!UICONTROL Direct accessible printer]**: A printer that is installed on the same computer is called a direct accessible printer, and the computer is named printer host. This type of printer can be a local printer that is connected to the computer directly.
* **[!UICONTROL Indirect accessible printer]**: The printer that is installed on a print server is accessed from other computers. Technologies such as the common UNIX® printing system (CUPS) and the Line Printer Daemon (LPD) protocol are available to connect to a network printer. To access an indirect accessible printer, specify the print server’s IP or host name. Using this mechanism, you can send a document to an LPD URI when the network has an LPD running. The mechanism lets you route the document to any printer that is connected to the network that has an LPD running.

### Generate Printed Output Step {#generatePrintedOutput}

The step generates a PCL, PostScript, ZPL, IPL, TPCL, or DPL output given a form design and data file. The data file is merged with the form design and formatted for printing. The output generated by this step can be sent directly to a printer or saved as file. It is recommended that you use this step when you want to use form designs or data from an application. If your form designs or form designs are located on the network, local file system, or HTTP location, use the generatePrintedOutput operation operation.

For example, your application requires that you merge a form design with a data file. The data contains hundreds of records. In addition, it requires the output is sent to a printer that supports ZPL. The form design and your input data are located in an application. Use the generatePrintedOutput operation to merge each record with a form design and send the output to a printer that supports ZPL.

The Generate Printed Output step has the following properties:

**[!UICONTROL Input properties]**

* **[!UICONTROL Select template file using]**: Specify the path of the template file. You can select the template file using the path that is relative to the payload, saved at an absolute path, or using a variable of Document data type. For example, [Payload_Directory]/Workflow/data.xml. If the path does not exist in crx-repository, an administrator can create the path before using it. Moreover, you can also accept payload as the input data file.

* **[!UICONTROL Select data document using]**: Specify the path of a input data file. You can select the input data file using the path that is relative to the payload, saved at an absolute path, or using a variable of Document data type. For example, [Payload_Directory]/Workflow/data.xml. If the path does not exist in crx-repository, an administrator can create the path before using it.

* **[!UICONTROL Printer Format]**: A Print Format value that specifies the page description language to use, when an XDC file is not provided, to generate the output stream. If you provide a literal value, select one of these values:

  * **[!UICONTROL Custom PCL]**: Use the option to specify a custom XDC file for PCL.
  * **[!UICONTROL Custom PostScript]**: Use the option to specify a custom XDC file for PostScript.

**[!UICONTROL Output Properties]**

* **[!UICONTROL Save output document using]**: Specify the location to save the output file. You can save the output file at an location  which is relative to the payload, in a variable, or specify an absolute location to save the output file. If the path does not exist in crx-repository, an administrator can create the path before using it.

**[!UICONTROL Advanced Properties]**

* **[!UICONTROL Select Content Root location using]**: Content root is a string value that specifies the URI, absolute reference, or location in the repository to retrieve relative assets used by the form design. For example, if the form design references an image relatively, such as ../myImage.gif, myImage.gif must be located at repository://. The default value is repository://, which points to the root level of the repository.

  When you pick an asset from your application, the Content Root URI path must have the correct structure. For example, if a form is picked from an application named SampleApp, and is placed at SampleApp/1.0/forms/Test.xdp, the Content Root URI must be specified as repository://administrator@password/Applications/SampleApp/1.0/forms/, or repository:/Applications/SampleApp/1.0/forms/ (when authority is null). When the Content Root URI is specified this way, the paths of all of the referenced assets in the form will be resolved against this URI.

* **[!UICONTROL Select XCI file using]**: XCI files are used to describe fonts and other properties that are used for form design elements. You can keep an XCI file relative to the payload, at an absolute path, or using a variable of Document data type.

  * **[!UICONTROL To use custom value]**:
    Type the Locale code in the literal box or select a string variable containing the locale code. For a complete list of supported locale codes, see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/intl/locale.doc.html.

* **[!UICONTROL Copies]**: An integer value that specifies the number of copies to generate for the output. The default value is 1.

* **[!UICONTROL Duplex Printing]**:  A Pagination value that specifies whether to use two-sided or single-sided printing. Printers that support PostScript and PCL use this value.If you provide a literal value, select one of these values:
    * **[!UICONTROL Duplex Long Edge]**: Use two-sided printing and print using long-edge pagination. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Duplex Short Edge]**: Use two-sided printing and print using short-edge pagination. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Simplex]**: Use single-sided printing.-->
