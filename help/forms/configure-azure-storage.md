# Configure [!DNL Azure] storage {#configure-azure-storage}

[[!DNL Experience Manager Forms] Data Integration](data-integration.md) provides an [!DNL Azure] storage configuration to integrate forms with [!DNL Azure] storage services. The Form Data Model can be used to create Adaptive Forms that interact with [!DNL Azure] server to enable business workflows. For example:

* Write data into [!DNL Azure] on Adaptive Form submission.
* Write data in [!DNL Azure] through custom entities defined in Form Data Model and vice versa.
* Query [!DNL Azure] server for data and prepopulate Adaptive Forms.
* Read data from [!DNL Azure] server.

## Create [!DNL Azure] storage configuration {#create-azure-storage-configuration}

Before executing these steps, ensure that you have an [!DNL Azure] storage account and an access key to authorize the access to the [!DNL Azure] storage account.

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Cloud Services]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Azure Storage]**.
1. Select a folder to create the configuration and tap **[!UICONTROL Create]**.
1. Specify a title for the configuration in the **[!UICONTROL Title]** field.
1. Specify the name of the [!DNL Azure] storage account in the **[!UICONTROL Azure Storage Account]** field.
1. Specify the key to access Azure storage account in the **[!UICONTROL Azure Access Key]** field and tap **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Create Form Data Model {#create-azure-form-data-model}

After creating the [!DNL Azure] storage configuration, you can [create the Form Data Model](create-form-data-models.md). Specify the folder that contains the [!DNL Azure] configuration in the **[!UICONTROL Data Source Configuration]** field while creating the Form Data Model. You can then select the configuration from the list of configurations that exist in the specified folder name.

### Add [!DNL Azure] services to the Form Data Model {#add-azure-services}

After creating the Form Data Model and data model objects, you can add [!DNL Azure] services to the Form Data Model.

To add [!DNL Azure] services:

1. In the Edit mode, select the services from the **[!UICONTROL Services]** section in the left pane and tap **[!UICONTROL Add Selected]**. The selected services display in the **[!UICONTROL Services]** tab of the Form Data Model.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Services]** tab, select the service and **[!UICONTROL Edit Properties]**. Based on the service, define the input or output model objects for the service.

1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the form data model.

   The following table describes the available [!DNL Azure] services:

    <table>
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <th><strong>Service Name</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Get Blob from Azure</td>
      <td>Retrieve data stored as a Blob in Azure storage using an ID or a name</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Get Blob with binaries URL from Azure</td>
      <td>Retrieve data stored as a Blob with URL for binaries in Azure storage using an ID or a name</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Save Blob in Azure</td>
      <td>Use a Blob ID to save data in Azure storage</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Update Blob in Azure</td>
      <td>Use a Blob ID to update data in Azure storage</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Retrieve list of Blob IDs from Azure</td>
      <td>Retrieve a list of Blob IDs from Azure based on the number defined in the input request.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Retrieve SAS URLs for Blobs from Azure</td>
      <td>Retrieve SAS URLs for Blobs from Azure based on Blob IDs in the input request.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Delete Blob from Azure</td>
      <td>Use a Blob ID to delete data from Azure storage</td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>

### Define a data model object property as a search key {#define-data-model-object-as-metadata}

To define a data model object property as a search key:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Model]** tab, select the data model object property and tap **[!UICONTROL Edit Properties]**.
1. Switch the **[!UICONTROL Search Key]** toggle option to the ON state. This option is available only for primary data types.
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Done]** and then tap **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the Form Data Model.

After defining data model object properties as search keys, the keys are saved as metadata in Azure storage.
