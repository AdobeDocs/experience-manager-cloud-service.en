# Repeatable sections in Edge Delivery

A repeatable section is a component of a form that is duplicated or replicated multiple times to gather information for multiple occurrences of the same data.

For example, consider a form used to collect information from users applying for a loan. The form allows users to provide personal information, including the co-loaner. Each address section includes fields for street address, city, state, ZIP code, and country. Users can fill in these sections as needed, depending on whether their communication or present living address differs from their permanent address.
