# Onboard to [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service {#overview}

## Decide personas {#personas-aem-forms-project}

<!-- When you sign up for the service, Adobe creates an Organization identifier for your company in the Adobe Identity Management System (IMS), where your users and their permissions can be managed. So, --> Before onboarding to an [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service environment, decide personas and structure a team for your project. A typical [!DNL AEM Forms] project team has the following personas:

* **User Experience (UX) designer**: A User Experience (UX) designer defines style, layout, and branding for [!DNL AEM Forms] assets. 

* **Forms practitioner**: A Forms practitioner creates Adaptive Forms, themes, and templates as per the style, layout, and branding provided by the UX designer. The practitioner also creates and integrates Adaptive Form with a Form Data Model and AEM Workflows. A Forms Practitioner typically undertakes front-end related tasks.

* **Forms developer**: A Forms developer develops a custom forms solution.  A Forms developer typically undertakes backend development like developing custom components, AEM Workflows, pre-fill service and more.

* **AEM administrator**:  An AEM administrator helps with overall configuration like setting up users, hardening the environment, configuring data sources, configuring email, and third party software. AEM administrator also helps with integrations like integrating with Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, and Adobe Sign.

* **End user**: An end user interacts with and submits the published form, signs submitted forms, tracks submitted applications through web portal, and receives personalized communications.

<!-- While onboarding to the service, assign the following AEM groups to [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service based on their role:

| User type | AEM group |
|---|---|
| Form Practitioner | forms-users (AEM Forms Users), template-authors, workflow-user, workflow-editors, and fdm-author  |
| UX Designer| forms-users, template-authors|
| End-User| <ul> <li>When a user must login to view and submit an Adaptive Form, add such users to forms-users group. </li> <li>When no user authentication is required to access Adaptive Forms, do not assign any group to such users. </li> </ul>| -->

## Onboard to the service {#onboarding}

* [Onboard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/home.html) to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service.

* (For Sandboxes only) After onboarding the service, [create](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/how-to-use/configuring-pipeline.html?lang=en#how-to-use) and [run](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/how-to-use/deploying-code.html) both production and non-production pipelines. It enables and brings latest features of [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service to your environment.

## Configure users {#config-users}

After you complete onboarding to the service, login to your [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service environment, open Author and Publish instances, and add users to Forms-specific [AEM groups](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/accessing/aem-users-groups-and-permissions.html#accessing), based on their persona. The following table lists Forms-specific AEM groups, available out of the box, and corresponding user types. The table also provides AEM instance type for each user type:  


| User types (Personas) | User groups | AEM instance |
|---|---|---|

| User Experience(UX) designer| <ul> <li> [!DNL forms-users]</li><li> [!DNL template-author] </li></ul>| Author instance |
| AEM administrator | <ul> <li>[!DNL aem-administrators],</li> <li>[!DNL fd-administrators] </li> </ul>| Author and Publish instance |
| End user| <ul> <li>When a user must log in to view and submit an Adaptive Form, add such users to [!DNL forms-users] group. </li> <li>When no user authentication is required to access Adaptive Forms, do not assign any group to such users. </li> </ul>| Author and Publish instance |

For more information about Forms-specific AEM groups and corresponding permissions, see [Groups and permissions](forms-groups-privileges-tasks.md).

<!-- You can also create  [user groups](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/accessing/aem-users-groups-and-permissions.html#accessing) specific  to your organization, assign policies, and [users](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/accessing/aem-users-groups-and-permissions.html#accessing) to the groups. The policies help control permissions of the users that are part of the group. For information a -->

## Next step {#next-steps}

[Set up a local development environment](setup-local-development-environment.md). You can use local development environment to create an Adaptive Form and related assets (Themes, Templates, custom Submit Actions, pre-fill service and more) and [convert PDF forms to Adaptive Forms](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/aem-forms-automated-conversion-service/using/introduction.html) without logging in to cloud development environment.

<!-- ## Onboard to the service {#onboarding}

[Onboard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/home.html) to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service. 

After you onboard the service, configure a [local development environment](setup-local-development-environment.md). 

Administrators are responsible for managing Adobe software and services for their organization. Administrators grant access to developers in their organization to connect and use your [!DNL AEM Forms] as a Cloud Service program. When an administrator is provisioned for an organization, the administrator receives an email with title â€˜You now have administrator rights to manage Adobe software and services for your organizationâ€™. If you are an administrator, check your mailbox for email with previously mentioned title and proceed to [add users](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/security/ims-support.html?lang=en#onboarding-users-in-admin-console) via IMS and assign [form-specific groups](forms-groups-privileges-tasks.md) to users based on their role.
