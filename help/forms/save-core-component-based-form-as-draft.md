# Save and list forms as drafts on Sites page

Consider a user who begins filling out a form but needs to pause and return later. The `save-as-draft` feature allows user to save the form as draft. Providing the  `save-as-draft` option ensures flexibility in managing time, reduces the risk of data loss, and maintains the precision of submissions. You can save forms as drafts to complete them later. 
AEM provides the **Drafts & Submissions** component out of the box to display lists and submissions on Sites pages. The **Drafts & Submissions** component shows forms that are saved as drafts for later completion, as well as submitted forms. The **Drafts & Submissions** component enables only logged-in users to edit drafts or view their submitted forms. However, if an anonymous user navigates through the list of forms provided by the **Search & Lister** component and saves a form as a draft, that draft is not listed by the **Drafts & Submissions** component. To view drafts and submissions, users must be logged in at the time of form submission.

## Pre-requisites

* [Enable Adaptive Forms Core Components for your environment.](/help/forms/enable-adaptive-forms-core-components.md)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Ensure that the [Core Components version is set to 3.0.24 or later](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components) to use `save-as-draft` feature.

    After deploying the latest Core Components to your environment, the Forms Portal components become accessible in your authoring environment.

* [Configure Azure Storage and Unified Storage Connector for Drafts & Submissions Forms Portal component](#configure-azure-storage-and-unified-storage-connector-for-drafts--submissions-forms-portal-component) 

### Configure Azure Storage and Unified Storage Connector for Drafts & Submissions Forms Portal component

The **Drafts & Submissions** component needs a storage setup for saving and listing drafts on AEM Sites page. The Unified Storage Connector offers a framework to link AEM with external storage. To save the form as a draft, ensure that you have an Azure storage account and an access key to authorize access to the [!DNL Azure] storage account. Once, you have Azure storage account and the access key, perform the following steps to create an Azure Storage configuration:

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Cloud Services]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Azure Storage]**.

    ![Azure Storage Card selection](/help/forms/assets/save-form-as-draft-azure-card.png){width="200" align="center"}

1. Select a configuration folder to create the configuration and select **[!UICONTROL Create]**.

     ![Select Azure Storage Configuration Folder](/help/forms/assets/save-form-as-draft-select-config-folder.png){width="200" align="center"}

1. Specify a title for the configuration in the **[!UICONTROL Title]** field.
1. Specify the name of the [!DNL Azure] storage account in the **[!UICONTROL Azure Storage Account]** and **[!UICONTROL Azure Access Key]** fields.

    ![Azure Storage Configuration](/help/forms/assets/save-form-as-draft-azure-storage.png){width="200" align="center"}

1. Click **Save**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > You can retrieve the **[!UICONTROL Azure Storage Account]** and **[!UICONTROL Azure Access Key]** from the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal).

    After, you have successfully created the Azure Storage Configuration, configure the Unified Storage Connector for Forms Portal, using the following steps:

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Forms]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Unified Storage Connector]**.

    ![Unified connector Storage](/help/forms/assets/save-form-as-draft-unified-connector.png){width="200" align="center"}

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Forms Portal]** section, select **[!UICONTROL Azure]** from the **[!UICONTROL Storage]** drop-down list.
1. Specify the configuration path for the Azure storage configuration in the **[!UICONTROL Storage Configuration Path]** field.

    ![Unified connector Storage setting](/help/forms/assets/save-form-as-draft-unified-connector-storage.png){width="200" align="center"}

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

Once you have successfully configured Azure Storage and Unified Storage Connector for storing the drafts and submitted forms, add the **Drafts & Submissions** component on AEM Sites page.

## How to add the Drafts & Submissions component to an AEM Sites page?

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Page Information]** > **[!UICONTROL Edit Template]**
    ![Edit template policy](/help/forms/assets/save-form-as-draft-edit-template.png){width="200" align="center"}

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Policy]** and select the **[!UICONTROL Drafts & Submissions]**  checkbox under the **[AEM Archetype Project Name] - Forms and Communications Portal**.

## Configure forms to save as drafts

You can configure Adaptive Forms in the following two ways to save them as drafts for later use:
* [User action](#user-action)
* [Auto-save](#auto-save)

### User action

To save a form as a Draft, create a **Save Form** rule on a form component, such as a button. When the button is clicked, the rule triggers, and the form is saved as a draft. Perform the following steps to create a **Save Form** rule on a button component:

1. Open an Adaptive Form in an edit mode.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Edit Rules]** icon to open the Rule Editor for the **Button** component. 
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Create]** to configure and create the rule for button.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL When]** section, select **is clicked** and in the **[!UICONTROL Then]** section, select the **Save Form** option.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Done]** to save the rule.

    ![Create rule for button](/help/forms/assets/save-form-as-drfat-create-rule.png){width="200" align="center"}

When you preview an Adaptive Form, fill it out, and click the **Save Form** button, the form is saved as a draft.

### Auto save

You can also configure an Adaptive Form to save automatically based on a time-based event, ensuring the form is saved after the specified duration. When you [enable Forms Portal components for your environment](/help/forms/list-forms-on-sites-page.md#enable-forms-portal-components-for-your-existing-environment), the **Auto Save** tab appears in the Forms container properties. You can configure the auto-save feature for an Adaptive Form:

1. In the author instance, open an Adaptive Form in an edit mode.
1. Open the Content browser, and select the **[!UICONTROL Guide Container]** component of your Adaptive Form. 
1. Click the Guide Container properties ![Guide properties](/help/forms/assets/configure-icon.svg) icon and open the **[!UICONTROL Auto-Save]** tab.

    ![Auto-save](/help/forms/assets/auto-save.png){width="200" align="center"}

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Enable]** check box to enable auto-save of the form.
1. Configure **[!UICONTROL Trigger]** as **Time based**, to auto-save the form <!--based on the occurrence of an event or--> after a specific interval of time.
1. Specify the time interval in **[!UICONTROL Auto save on this interval (In seconds)]** to set the duration that triggers the automatic saving of the form at the defined interval.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Done]**.
 
## View drafts/submitted forms on Sites page using the Drafts & Submissions component

To view saved drafts or submitted forms, use the **Drafts & Submissions** Forms Portal component. 
When **[!UICONTROL Select Type]** is selected as **Draft Forms** in the [configure dialog of the Drafts & Submissions component](#configure-properties-of-the-drafts--submissions-component), the forms saved as drafts appear on the Sites page. You can open the drafts by clicking on the ellipsis (...) to complete the form.

![Drafts icon](assets/drafts-component.png){width="200" align="center"}

When **[!UICONTROL Select Type]** is selected as **Submitted Forms** in the [configure dialog of the Drafts & Submissions component](#configure-properties-of-the-drafts--submissions-component), the submitted forms appear. You can view the submitted forms but cannot edit them.

![Submissions icon](assets/submission-listing.png){width="200" align="center"}

You can also discard the forms by clicking on the ellipsis (...) that appears in the bottom-right corner of the form.
