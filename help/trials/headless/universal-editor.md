## Edit Text in Context {#edit-text}

The Universal Editor allows you to interact and edit your content within its context, seeing the content as it is delivered to your end users and allowing you to edit it in-place.

1. The Universal Editor presents your content as your readers will see it. Note the opening sentence of the latest article, *Aloha Spirits in Northern Norway*, and see how the first sentence is a bit long.

1. Readers may be on different devices with different aspect ratios, so the editor has emulation modes. To see how the page will be presented to users on a mobile device, tap or click the emulator icon and select the mobile device in portrait mode. See how that opening sentence is automatically wrapped when going from desktop to mobile modes.

1. Seeing how long the sentence appears in mobile mode, let's shorten it a bit. Select the paragraph by tapping or touching and you can edit the text in-place. Replace the first sentence with the shorter text `Experience the majestic beauty of Lofoten like never before!`

1. With the paragraph still selected, you can use the edit rail to further format your text. For example, if you can convert your new sentence to a subheading by selecting H2 as the **Font Style**.

Your changes are automatically saved as you make them.

## Edit Media in Context {#edit-media}

You can also edit your media in-context and in-place just as you did your text.

1. In the mode rail on the left side of the editor, select **Media**.

1. Tap or click the image of the surfer to select it.

1. In the edit rail on the right side of the editor, you see the details of the image. Add `Surfer man in Northern Norway` as the **Alt text**.

Your changes are automatically saved as you make them.

## Previewing and Publishing {#preview}

The editor renders the context as your readers will see it. Because you need to tap or click your content to select it, the editor does not allow you to follow links or interact with your content by tapping or clicking. Using preview mode, you can experience the content as it will be published.

1. In the mode rail on the left side of the editor, tap or click **Preview**.

1. Review the changes, and if everything looks okay, tap or click **Publish**.

Your content is published.

## Editing Content Fragments {#editing-fragments}

The Universal Editor gives you quick access to the Content Fragment editor as well, to accelerate your content authoring experience.

1. Scroll further down on the page to the **Adventures** section.

1. In the mode rail on the left side of the editor, select **Components**. This allows you to select page components in the editor.

1. Tap or click one of the adventures to select it. A new **Edit** icon appears on the mode rail.

1. Tap or click the **Edit** icon on the mode rail to open the Content Fragment editor on a new tab.

You can now edit your Content Fragment that you selected in the Universal Editor.
