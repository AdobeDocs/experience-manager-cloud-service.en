## Edit Text in Context {#edit-text}

Using the Universal Editor, you can edit your text in-context and in-place, allowing simple and intuitive content authoring.

Editing in-place and in-context can often be advantageous for certain authors over structure content editing in the Content Fragment editor which you saw in previous modules.

1. Tap or click the title of the latest article to edit it.

1. The component is selected as indicated by a blue border with a tab indicating that it is a text component. A cursor is in the border awaiting text input. Change the text to `Aloha Spirit in Lofoten`.

1. Press the enter/return key or tap or click outside of the text component and your changes are saved automatically.

The Universal Editor saves your changes automatically, but they are only persisted in the authoring environment. You still need to publish them for your readers to see.

## Experience Your Content As Your Readers Do {#emulators}

The Universal Editor allows you to interact with your content within its context, seeing the content as it is delivered to the devices of your end users

1. By default the editor renders the desktop version of your content. Tap or click the emulator button at the top-right of the editor to change the target device.

1. Readers may be on different devices with different aspect ratios, so the editor has emulation modes. To see how the page will be presented to users on a mobile device, select the mobile device option in portrait mode.

1. See the content change in the editor. The icon for the emulator also changes to reflect the mode it is in. Tap or click anywhere outside of the emulator menu to close it and interact with your content.

1. Return the emulator to desktop mode.

You can also specify exact dimensions for the emulator and rotate the emulated device in order to view your content on any potential target device.


## Previewing and Publishing {#preview}

The editor renders the context as your readers will see it. Because you need to tap or click your content to select it, the editor does not allow you to follow links or interact with your content by tapping or clicking. Using preview mode, you can experience the content as it will be published before publishing.

1. In the mode rail on the left side of the editor, tap or click **Preview**.

1. The page is opened in preview mode in a new browser tab.

1. Review the changes, and if everything looks okay, return to the Universal Editor tab of your browser and tap or click **Publish**.

Your content is published.

## Editing Content Fragments {#editing-fragments}

The Universal Editor gives you quick access to the Content Fragment editor as well, to accelerate your content authoring experience.

1. Scroll further down on the page to the **Adventures** section.

1. In the mode rail on the left side of the editor, select **Components**. This allows you to select page components in the editor.

1. Tap or click one of the adventures to select it. A new **Edit** icon appears on the mode rail.

   * Note the blue outline. The tab should read **reference** when a Content Fragment is selected.
   * Because the Universal Editor allows selecting any object on the page, components that parts of a Content Fragment can also be selected individually.

1. Tap or click the **Edit** icon on the mode rail to open the Content Fragment editor on a new tab.

On the new tab, you can now edit your Content Fragment that you selected in the Universal Editor.
