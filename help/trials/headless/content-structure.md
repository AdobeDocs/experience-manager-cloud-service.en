## Create a Model {#create-model}

The Content Fragment model console opens in a new tab. Think of the Content Fragment model console as your library of models, where you create new models and manage existing models.

For our example, we will create a model that represents the data structure of a trip that is featured on a travel website. We will refer to a trip in this model as an **Adventure.**

1. Click the **Create** button at the top-right of the screen to begin creating a Content Fragment model.

1. The Create Model wizard starts, which guides you through creating your model. Provide the mandatory information.

   * **Model Title** - This is a brief description of the model and usually indicates the purpose of the model. We will call our new model `Adventure`.
   * **Enable model** - This option is checked by default and must be checked to be able to create Content Fragments based on this model.

1. Once the mandatory fields are populated, click **Create** at the top-left to create the model. 

1. The **Success** dialog confirms that the model was created. Click **Open** in the dialog to open your new Content Fragment Model in the editor in a new tab. Then continue on to the next step to adding data fields to your model.

## Using the Model Editor {#configure-model}

We now have a model called **Adventure** to represent trips on a travel website, but it has no details like duration, destination, activities, etc. Before you can use your model, you need to define the structure of its data. 

The Content Fragment Model editor is where you configure the data types and properties that define the content of your model.

>[!TIP]
>
>We will add a few important fields for the **Adventure**. In later modules we'll use and add to the model, so please follow the naming schema as provided.

1. Drag a **Single line text** field from the **Data Types** panel at the right of the editor and drop it onto your Content Fragment model. 

1. Once a data type is placed, the **Data Types** column automatically changed to the **Properties** tab, where you can define the details of the data type you just placed. For this first field, we want to store the title of the trip or adventure. Enter the following properties.

   * **Render As:** **Text Field** - When you create an adventure, this field will store the title of the adventure.
   * **Field Label:** `Title` - This is the label that is displayed for this field when creating a new adventure.

1. Once you define the properties of the field you can switch back to the **Data Types** tab in the right panel and add additional fields by dragging and dropping.

In this way, you can add as many fields as necessary to your model to support whatever kind of data structure you may need. The types of data fields vary, but the process of adding them to your model remains the same.

Continue on to the next section to add the fields necessary to complete the **Adventure** model.

## Add Fields to the Model {#additional-fields}

We already have a field for the title of the adventure. Now we need to add fields to capture the description, price, itinerary, and a representative image of the trip.

>[!TIP]
>
>The **Adventure** model is based on the WKND sample site for AEM. You can [visit the site here](https://wknd.site/us/en/adventures/yosemite-backpacking.html) to learn more about it if you wish, but knowledge of it is not necessary for these learning modules.

Follow the same steps as above to add these additional fields. The only difference are the properties you need to set.

1. Add a field to store the description of the adventure by dragging and dropping a **Multi line text** field and enter the following properties:

   * **Render As:** **Text Area** - When you create an adventure, this field will store a brief description of the trip.
   * **Field Label:** `Description` - This is the label that is displayed for this field when creating a new adventure.

1. Add a field to store the price of the adventure by dragging and dropping a **Single line text** field and enter the following properties:

   * **Render As:** **Text field** - When you create an adventure, this field will store the price of the trip.
   * **Field Label:** `Price` - This is the label that is displayed for this field when creating a new adventure.

1. Add a field to store an image representing the trip. Images in AEM are stored as another type of content called **Assets**. So to create a field for them you need to drag and drop a **Content Reference** field that will reference the asset of the image.

   * **Render As:** **Content Reference** - When you create an adventure, this field will point to the image asset representing this trip.
   * **Field Label:** `Image` - This is the label that is displayed for this field when creating a new adventure.

1. Once you have added all of the fields necessary for the Content Fragment model, click **Save** at the top-right of the window.

1. The model is saved and you return to the Content Fragment model Console.
