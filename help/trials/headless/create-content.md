## Create a Content Fragment {#create-fragment}

Content Fragments represent your headless content and are based on predefined structures, called Content Fragment models. You already created a model in a previous module.

In this module you will create a new Content Fragment based on that model by using the Content Fragment console. Think of the Content Fragment console as your library of headless content. Use it to create new Content Fragments and manage existing fragments.

1. Tap or click the **Create** button at the top-right of the console.

1. The **New Content Fragment** dialog opens where you can  start creating a new Content Fragment. **Location** is automatically populated with where the new content will be saved.

1. In the **Content Fragment model** drop-down, select the **Adventure** Content Fragment model you created previously.

1. Add `Tuscany` as a descriptive **Title** for the Content Fragment. This is to identify your fragment in the console in a new browser tab.

1. Tap or click **Create and open**.

>[!TIP]
>
>Depending on your browser settings, the new browser tab might be suppressed by a pop-up blocker. If your new fragment does not open after clicking **Create and open**, please check your browser settings.

## Add Content to your Content Fragment {#add-content}

Once you save and open your new Content Fragment, the Content Fragment editor opens on a new tab. Here you can add the content of your new fragment.

1. The Content Fragment editor shows the fields you defined in the selected model. Here you can add content to each field to complete your Content Fragment. Your progress is saved automatically.

1. Provide a **Title** for your fragment by entering `Tuscan adventure`.

1. Provide a **Description** for your fragment by pasting in the following text: `Visiting Tuscany on a bicycle is about experiencing the old world charm of Italy on your own terms. Your efforts on the climbs of Italy's rolling hills during this tour will be rewarded with sunny Mediterranean landscapes and unmatched Italian hospitality.  Tuscanyâ€™s natural wonders have always been a well of inspiration for arts and culture. Find out why as you explore the Italian countryside and coastline on bicycle.

1. Provide a **Price** for your fragment by entering in `$700`.

1. Provide an **Image** that is representative of the trip.

   1. Under the **Image** field, click **Add asset**.
   1. Magic happens.

Once you are finished adding content, tap or click the **Publish** button at the top-right of the editor. This makes your Content Fragment available for consumption by external apps. 

1. Select **Now** from the drop-down. You can also schedule it to publish at a later time.

1. The **Publish Content Fragments** dialog appears. AEM automatically performs a reference check to make sure that all necessary resources are published for your Content Fragment. In this case, you will also need to publish the model that you created. Tap or click **Publish**.

Your content is published and ready to be delivered to your app or website as a Content Fragment.
