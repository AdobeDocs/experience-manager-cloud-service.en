## Create a Content Fragment {#create-fragment}

Clicking the **Launch the Content Fragment console** button above opens the Content Fragment console in a new tab.

Content Fragments represent your headless content and are based on predefined structures, called Content Fragment models. Think of the the Content Fragment console as your library of headless content. Use it to create new Content Fragments and manage existing ones. Your console starts empty, so let's create a new fragment!

1. Tap or click the **Create** button at the top-right of the console.

1. The **New Content Fragment** dialog opens where you can  start creating a new Content Fragment. **Location** will be automatically populated with where the new content will be saved.

1. In the **Content Fragment model** drop-down, select the Content Fragment model you created previously.

1. Add a **Title** for the Content Fragment.

1. Tap or click **Create and open**.

## Add Content to your Content Fragment {#add-content}

Once you save and open your new Content Fragment, the Content Fragment editor opens on a new tab. Here you can add the content of your new fragment.

1. The Content Fragment editor shows the fields you defined in the selected model. Here you can add content to each field to complete your Content Fragment. Your progress is saved automatically.

1. Once you are finished adding content, tap or click the **Publish** button at the top-right of the editor. This makes your Content Fragment available for consumption by external apps. 

1. Select **Now** from the drop-down. You can also schedule it to publish at a later time.

1. The **Publish Content Fragments** dialog appears. AEM automatically performs a reference check to make sure that all necessary resources are published for your Content Fragment. In this case, you will also need to publish the model that you created. Tap or click **Publish**.
