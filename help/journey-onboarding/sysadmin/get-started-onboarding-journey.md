# Get Started with Onboarding Process {#getting-started}

Onboarding is the process during which a designated [System Administrator](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/onboarding-concepts/system-administrator.html?lang=en) sets up AEM as a Cloud Service for your organization. This includes the initial provisioning of cloud resources and assigning users to roles based on their job responsibilities. As a result, each member is able to login and access their AEM as a Cloud Service resources.
