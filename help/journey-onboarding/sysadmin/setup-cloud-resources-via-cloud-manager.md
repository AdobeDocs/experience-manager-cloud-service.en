# Setup Cloud Resources via Cloud Manager {#setup-cloud-resources}

Lean how to use Cloud Manager to set up and manage your own cloud resources.

## Objective {#objective}

This document helps you understand how your cloud resources are created and who can create them. After reading this section you should understand:

* A System Administrator assigned to the **Business Owner** role must be the first in your organization to login and access Cloud Manager.
* How your cloud program and environments are created.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Adding your cloud resources is done via Cloud Manager by your team member assigned to the **Business Owner** product profile. This individual is typically one who understand the business needs and who completes the initial Cloud Manager setup.

Follow the sections below to learn how to create your [cloud service programs](#create-cloud-service-program) and [environments.](#create-cloud-environments)

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

* The System Administrator assigned to the **Business Owner** role must have logged into to Cloud Manager before any other users with the **Business Owner** role attempt to access Cloud manager to perform and steps described in this document.

   * Return to the [Assign Team Members to Cloud Manager Product Profiles](/help/journey-onboarding/sysadmin/assign-team-members-cloud-manager.md) document of this journey for more information.

* You must understand how to [navigate and login to Cloud Manager.](/help/onboarding/learn-concepts/cloud-manager-introduction.md)

* You should be familiar with [Cloud Manager product profiles.](/help/onboarding/learn-concepts/aem-cs-team-product-profiles.md#cloud-manager-product-profiles)

* You should understand the concepts of Cloud Manager [programs](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/understand-program-types.md) and [environments.](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/manage-environments.md)

## Access Cloud Manager as System Administrator and Business Owner {#access-sysadmin-bo}

Before the team members that you assigned to the **Business Owner** role can access cloud manager and begin creating cloud resources, the System Administrator must be assigned the **Business Owner** role and sign into Cloud Manager.

1. Ensure that you, as System Administrator, have the **Business Owner** role assigned.

   * Return to the previous step in this journey, [Assign Team Members to Cloud Manager Product Profiles,](/help/journey-onboarding/sysadmin/assign-team-members-cloud-manager.md) for more information about assigning the **Business Owner** role to the System Administrator if you have not already done this.

1. Sign into Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and be presented with the normal landing page.

By successfully signing in as System Administrator with the **Business Owner** role, you initialize Cloud Manager for use by the other users with the **Business Owner** role. You will not receive a confirmation of this or any message. Simply signing in suffices.

Until you sign in to Cloud Manager as System Administrator with the **Business Owner** role, other users with the **Business Owner** role will not be able to create programs in Cloud Manager even if they are assigned the correct roles.

## Navigate to Cloud Manager {#navigate-cloud-manager}

The user with the **Business Owner** role will receive a welcome email with a link to get started. Follow the steps below to navigate to Cloud Manager using this welcome email.

1. From your welcome email click on **Get started**, as shown in the figure below.
