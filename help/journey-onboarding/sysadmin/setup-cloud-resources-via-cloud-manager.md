# Setup Cloud Resources via Cloud Manager {#setup-cloud-resources}

Lean how to use Cloud Manager to set up and manage your own cloud resources.

## Objective {#objective}

This document helps you understand how your cloud resources are created and who can create them. After reading this section you should understand:

* A System Administrator assigned to the **Business Owner** role must be the first in your organization to login and access Cloud Manager.
* How your cloud program and environments are created.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Adding your cloud resources is done via Cloud Manager by your team member assigned to the **Business Owner** product profile. This individual is typically one who understand the business needs and who completes the initial Cloud Manager setup.

Follow the sections below to learn how to create your [cloud service programs](#create-cloud-service-program) and [environments.](#create-cloud-environments)

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

* The System Administrator assigned to the **Business Owner** role should access and login to Cloud Manager.

* Understand how to [navigate and login to Cloud Manager](/help/onboarding/learn-concepts/cloud-manager-introduction.md)

* Be familiar with [Cloud Manager product profiles](/help/onboarding/learn-concepts/aem-cs-team-product-profiles.md#cloud-manager-product-profiles)

* Understand the concepts of Cloud Manager [programs](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/understand-program-types.md) and [environments](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/manage-environments.md)

   Great work! Now your program is successfully created and your Cloud Manager Git is available for your Developers to access! 

   Congratulations! Now, your cloud program environments have been created and your Developers have been added to the team!

## Whatâ€™s Next {#whats-next}

Your team members must be granted permissions to the instance, since permissions to administer Cloud Manager will not suffice. Now that your cloud resources have been created and are ready to be accessed by your team, the System Administrator must assign your team members to AEM as a Cloud Service product profiles from Adobe Admin Console.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To be granted access to AEM as a Cloud Service users must belong to one of two product profiles `AEM Users` or `AEM Administrators`. See [Managing Products and User Access in Admin Console](/help/security/ims-support.md#managing-products-and-user-access-in-admin-console) to learn more.

You should continue your onboarding journey by next reviewing the document [Assigning Team Members to AEM as a Cloud Service Product Profiles.](/help/journey-onboarding/sysadmin/assign-team-members-aem-cloud-service.md)
