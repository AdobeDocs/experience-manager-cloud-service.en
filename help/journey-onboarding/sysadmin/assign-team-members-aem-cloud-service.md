# Assign Team Members to AEM as a Cloud Service Product Profiles {#assign-team-members-cloud-service}

## Objective {#objective}

This document helps you understand the steps that your System Administrator must take to assign your team members to AEM as a Cloud Service product profiles and why it is crucial to enable your AEM Authors to embark on their journey with AEM. 

After reading this section you should understand:

* Why and how your team members are assigned to AEM as a Cloud Service product profiles.
* How to add team members to AEM User product profile.
* How to add team members to AEM Administrators product profile.


## Introduction {#introduction}

To be granted access to AEM as a Cloud Service users must belong to one of two product profiles:  `AEM Users` or `AEM Administrators`. Your team members must be granted permissions to the AEM instance, since permissions to administer Cloud Manager will not suffice.

>[!NOTE]
>Every user assigned to AEM User product profile by the system administrator will have (read-only) access to Cloud Manager.
