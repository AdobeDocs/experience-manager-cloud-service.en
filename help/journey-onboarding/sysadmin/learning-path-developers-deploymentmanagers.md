* As a Deployment Manager, be able to understand how to set up pipelines and deploy your code in Cloud Manager 

## Introduction {#introduction}

If you are reading this section, then you are likely assigned to a Developer or Deployment Manager product profile and are ready to onboard and continue your learning path. 

>[!NOTE]
>* As a *Developer*, you will want to login to Cloud Manager and familiarize yourself with accessing Git. 
>* As a *Deployment Manager*, you will want to familiarize yourself with how to setup pipelines and even deploy code.

## Pre-requisites {#prerequisites}

Before you start, ensure:
 
* Your system administrator has assigned Developers and Deployment Managers to their respective product profiles. Developers must additionally be assigned to AEM Users or AEM Administrators product profile.
