# Assign Team Members to Cloud Manager Product Profiles {#assign-team-members}

In this part of the [onboarding journey,](overview.md) you will learn how to assign team members to Cloud Manager product profiles.

## Objective {#objective}

In the previous step in this journey, [Accessing the Admin Console,](admin-console.md) you learned now log in to the Admin Console and verify your privileges as a system administrator. You are now ready to allow your team members access to Cloud Manager. You do this by assigning product profiles.

When granting users access to an Adobe solution, you do not necessarily want to give them full access. Product profiles enable each solution to have its own set of user permissions. You use the Admin Console to assign product profiles.

Your first step is to grant users access to Cloud Manager. Cloud manager support you with enterprise development setups and its purpose-built CI/CD pipelines, which are equipped to ensure thorough testing and highest code quality to deliver exceptional experiences.

After reading this document you should:

* Understand what product profiles are.
* Understand what Cloud Manager is.
* Know the three important Cloud Manager product profiles: **Business Owner**, **Deployment Manager**, and **Developer**.
* Be able to assign team members to Cloud Manager product profiles.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To assign team members to product profiles, you will need to have details about your team members, who will need to access AEM as a Cloud Service, including:

* Names
* Email addresses
* Roles and responsibilities 

>[!TIP]
>
>For the purpose of onboarding, Adobe recommends that you initially add users who will participate in the immediate tasks, such as administrators, developers, and content authors.
>
>You can continue the onboarding process without adding all users. After you have finished onboarding, you can add additional users.

## Product Profiles {#product-profiles}

When granting users access to an Adobe solution, you do not necessarily want to give them full access. Product profiles enable each solution to have its own set of user permissions which are set using the Admin Console.

For example, later in this journey you will use the Admin Console to grant users access to the AEM solution by assigning product profiles for AEM administrators and AEM authors.

However the next step is to grant product profiles so your team members first have access to Cloud Manager.

## Cloud Manager {#cloud-manager}

As system administrator, you know that a successful AEM as a Cloud Service project depends not only on the creation of amazing content using AEM, but also the development and deployment of your own custom code and applications to deliver your AEM content.

Cloud Manager is an integral part of AEM as a Cloud Service and is used to manage your CI/CD pipelines for code deployment, manage your code repositories, and manage your environments.

Before your team can do anything else, they must be onboarded into Cloud Manager by granting them the necessary product profiles. The next steps show you where to find the Cloud Manager product profile using the Admin Console and how to assign them to your team members.

## Review Cloud Manager Product Profiles {#review-product-profiles}

Using the Admin Console you can see the list of Cloud Manager profiles. 

1. Log in to Adobe Admin Console at [adminconsole.adobe.com](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) and from the **Overview** page, select **Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service** from the **Products and services** card.

1. Navigate to the **Cloud Manager** instance from the list of all instances. 

    ![Cloud Manager](/help/journey-onboarding/assets/assign-team2.png)

1. You will see the list of pre-configured Cloud Manager product profiles. 
   
   ![Product profiles](/help/journey-onboarding/assets/assign-team3.png)

The most important profiles to assign as part of the initial onboarding process are:

* **Business Owner** - These users manage different programs.
* **Deployment Manager** - These users deploy code from your repositories to running AEM environments.
* **Developer** - These users develop your custom AEM applications and commit code to your repositories.

Knowing what these roles are and what they do, review your list of team members to determine who needs which profile. Keep in mind that users can have and often do have multiple roles in your team and therefore also need multiple profiles.

## Assign the Business Owner Product Profile {#assign-business-owner}
