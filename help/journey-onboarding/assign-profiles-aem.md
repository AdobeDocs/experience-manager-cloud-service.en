# Assigning AEM Product Profiles {#assign-profiles-aem}

Once you have your cloud resources configured, you will need to grant your team access to AEM itself using AEM product profiles.

## Objective {#objective}

By following this onboarding journey you now have set up your team in the Admin Console and created the necessary programs and environments using Cloud Manager. Before your colleagues can beginning using AEM as a Cloud Service, however, they need to be granted access to AEM itself. As the system administrator, you do this by assigning AEM product profiles.

After reading this document you should understand:

* Why and how your team members are assigned to AEM as a Cloud Service product profiles.
* How to add team members to AEM User product profile.
* How to add team members to AEM Administrators product profile.

## AEM Product Profiles {#aem-product-profiles}

To be granted access to AEM as a Cloud Service, users must belong to one of two product profiles:

* `AEM Users` - This group includes normal users who perform everyday content authoring tasks.
* `AEM Administrators` - This group includes users who are responsible for advanced features or AEM.

To use AEM, your team members must be assigned to at least one AEM product profile. Permissions to access Cloud Manager will not suffice.

Every user assigned to an AEM product profile will also gain read-only access to Cloud Manager. Write access to Cloud Manager may be granted via other product profiles.

## Pre-requisites {#prerequisites}

Before you start reading this section, you should have the following information available about your team who will use AEM.

* Names
* Email addresses
* Roles and responsibilities

>[!TIP]
>
>For the purpose of onboarding, we recommend that you initially add users who will participate in the immediate tasks, such as administrators, developers and content authors. You can continue the rest of the onboarding without adding all users. After you have finished onboarding, you can scale to a larger number of users later.

## Add Team Members to Product Profiles {#add-team-members}

Now that you are familiar with the available profiles, you can assign them as necessary to your team members.

1. Navigate to your program from Cloud Manager and select the **Manage Access** button from the context of the environment of interest.
