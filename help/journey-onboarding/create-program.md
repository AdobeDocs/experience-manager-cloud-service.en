   >For step by step instruction on how to use the Add Program wizard, go refer to the document [Creating Production Programs](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/creating-production-programs.md) or watch this [video](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/cloud-manager/programs.html) to learn how to create your AEM as a Cloud program and learn about important considerations before creating your program.

   
1. Upon successful creation of your cloud program you can navigate to your program from the Cloud Manager landing page to see the **Overview** page of your program.

1. Members assigned to the Developer product profile can login to Cloud Manager and manage Cloud Manager git repositories.

   * If you have not already done so, now is a good time to assign members to the **Developer** role in your Cloud Manager team. Return to the [Assign Team Members to Cloud Manager Product Profiles](/help/journey-onboarding/sysadmin/assign-team-members-cloud-manager.md) document of this journey for more information.

Now your program is successfully created and your Cloud Manager git repository is available for your developers to access! 

## Whatâ€™s Next {#whats-next}

Now that your first program is created, you can create environments for it. You should continue your onboarding journey by next reviewing the document [Create Environments.](create-environments.md)
