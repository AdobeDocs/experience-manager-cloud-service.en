## Create Environments {#create-environments}

Once you have successfully created your cloud program, create your cloud environments.

1. Navigate to the Cloud Manager landing page at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select **Add** from the environment card.

1. Members assigned to the **Developer** product profile can login to Cloud Manager and manage Cloud Manager git repositories.

Now your program is successfully created and your Cloud Manager git is available for your developers to access!


## Whatâ€™s Next {#whats-next}

Now that your cloud resources have been created and are ready to be accessed by your team, as the system administrator you must assign your team members to AEM as a Cloud Service product profiles from Adobe Admin Console in order for them to access those resources.

You should continue your onboarding journey by next reviewing the document [Assigning Team Members to AEM as a Cloud Service Product Profiles](assign-profiles-aem.md) where you will learn how to grant your team members the rights they need to access your new environments.
