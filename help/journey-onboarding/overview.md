# Onboarding Journey {#onboarding-journey}

Congratulations on choosing AEM as a Cloud Service! This document is your starting point for a guided journey through the onboarding process. Whether you are deploying a new application or migrating an existing one, this onboarding journey ensures that your teams are set up and have access to AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Adobe Experience Manager is a powerful suite of composable content services that rapidly deliver highly impactful, personalized experiences across any channel, unlocking content from all for all. **Edge Delivery Services** is the latest innovation in Adobe Experience Manager that enables extreme content velocity and delivers exceptional experiences. Learn how to get started with Edge Delivery Services, by visiting [this page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview.html). To understand how to use Edge Delivery Services, see the [Developer Tutorial](https://www.hlx.live/developer/tutorial) page.

Onboarding is the process during which a designated system administrator sets up AEM as a Cloud Service for your organization. This process includes the initial provisioning of cloud resources and assigning users to roles based on their job responsibilities. As a result, each member is able to log on and access their resource on AEM as a Cloud Service.

This guide leads you through the most important onboarding topics so that on completion you have the following:

* Full understanding of the different terms, services, and users involved in the onboarding process.
* Enabled your team to get up and running and take the first steps towards learning how to author and develop content for your AEM as a Cloud Service application.

As a result:

* Your team is set up and has access to cloud resources.
* AEM authors have access to AEM as a Cloud Service and can begin creating content.
* AEM developers and deployment managers have access to AEM as a Cloud Service and can begin creating and deploying custom applications.

## Concepts and Goal {#concepts}

Although there may appear to be a lot to learn when getting started with AEM as a Cloud Service, conceptually there are only a few, logical pieces.

* **The Contract** - You must be familiar with your Adobe contract since it defines aspects of the onboarding process.
* **Admin Console** - Where users are managed and roles are assigned.
* **Cloud Manager** - The tool to set up resources such as programs and environments. It is also where you access git and create pipelines to manage and deploy your custom code.

These concepts are laid out in detail in this onboarding journey. The goal is that at the end of the journey, you:

* Have granted the necessary user's access to AEM as a Cloud Service.
* Have set up the first cloud resources for your project.
* Know how to deploy your first code and author your first content.

Basically, you hit the ground running with your new AEM as a Cloud Service project!

## Audience {#audience}

The onboarding journey is written specifically for the **system administrator** of customer's new to AEM as a Cloud Service and to AEM in general. The system administrator is the individual who is first contacted by Adobe after your AEM as a Cloud Service contract is signed. They are typically the first person to access and set up your resources on AEM as a Cloud Service. If you are reading this topic, it is likely that you are the system administrator.

The system administrator manages all aspects of their organization's AEMaaCS users, from access to permissions. However the system administrator must interact with other personas along the way.

|Persona|Description|Role in Journey|
|---|---|---|
|System administrator|Target of this journey, provides initial provisioning of cloud resources and assignment of users to appropriate roles based on their job responsibilities|Manages all aspects of users from access to permissions|
|Content author|Creates and reviews the content in AEM|Once granted permissions by the system administrator, authors can start their own journey creating content|
|Developer|Develops AEM applications which consume content from different sources|Once granted permissions by the system administrator, developers can start their own journey developing solutions|
|Deployment manager|Adds or updates an environment, runs pipelines, and deploys code to AEM environment or code-quality.|Once granted permissions by the system administrator, deployment managers can start their own journey managing deployments|

This onboarding guide illustrates the complete process of onboarding as a system administrator. The roles of AEM users, developers, and deployment managers are explored briefly as additional, optional parts of the journey.
