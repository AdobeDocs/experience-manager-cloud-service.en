# Notification Profiles {#notification-profiles}

Learn how to create user profiles in the Admin Console to manage receipt of important email notifications.

## Overview {#overview}

From time-to-time, Adobe needs to contact users regarding their AEM as a Cloud Service environments. In addition to in-product notifications, Adobe also occasionally uses email for notifications. There are two types of such email notification:

* **Incident Notification** - These notifications are sent during an incident or when Adobe has identified a potential availability issue with your AEM as a Cloud Service environment.
* **Proactive Notification** - These notifications are sent when an Adobe support team member wants to provide guidance on a potential optimization or recommendation that can benefit your AEM as a Cloud Service environment.

For the correct users to receive these notifications, you need to configure and assign user profiles as described in this document.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Because user profiles are created and maintained in the Admin Console, before creating profiles for notifications, you must:

* Have permissions to add and profile memberships.
* Have a valid Adobe Admin Console profile.

## Create New Cloud Manager Product Profiles {#create-profiles}

To properly set up receipt of notifications you will need to create two user profiles. These steps must only be done once.

1. Log in to Admin Console at [`https://adminconsole.adobe.com`.](https://adminconsole.adobe.com)

1. Ensure that you are in the correct organization.

1. From the **Overview** page, select **Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service** from the **Products and services** card.

1. Click **New Profile** and provide the following details:

   * **Product profile name**: `Incident Notification - Cloud Service`
   * **Display name**: `Incident Notification - Cloud Service`
   * **Description**: Cloud Manager profile for the users that will receive notifications during an incident or when Adobe has identified a potential availability problem with your AEM as a Cloud Service environment

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **New Profile** once more and provide the following details:

   * **Product profile name**: `Proactive Notification - Cloud Service`
   * **Display name**: `Proactive Notification - Cloud Service`
   * **Description**: Cloud Manager profile for the users that will receive notifications when an Adobe support team member wants to provide guidance on a potential optimization or recommendation to do with your AEM as a Cloud Service environment configuration

1. Click **Save**.

Your two new notification profiles are created.

>[!NOTE]
>
>It is important that the Cloud Manager **product profile name** is exactly the same as provided. Please copy and paste the provided product profile name to avoid errors. Any deviations or typos will result in notifications not being sent as desired.
>
>In case of error or if the profiles have not been defined, Adobe will default to notifying existing users assigned to the **Cloud Manager Developer** or **Deployment Manager** profiles.
