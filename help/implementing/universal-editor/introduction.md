# Universal Editor Introduction {#introduction}

Learn how the Universal Editor enables editing any aspect of any content in any implementation in order to deliver exceptional experiences, increase content velocity, and provide a state-of-the-art developer experience.

## Background {#background}

The most powerful tool to the AEM content author has been the page editor. The page editor offers an intuitive, visual, in-context WYSIWYG authoring experience that requires minimal training and shows authors exactly how the content will appear.

However the page editor can only edit AEM page content, structure, and the components contained therein. Content today, however, is rarely sourced from one location. The Universal Editor offers the same in-place editing experience as the page editor but for any aspect of any content in any implementation.

## Truly Universal {#universal}

The Universal Editor can be instrumented for any implementation, for any content, and for any aspect of the content.

### Any Implementation {#any-implementation}

Because experiences can be built in many different ways, any implementation can leverage the Universal Editor so authors can perform in-context editing.

Users often think that a headless implementation limits the authors to editing all content in a form-based UI, but his isnâ€™t true with the Universal Editor

The requirements for an implementation to leverage the Universal Editor is very straight-forward and supports:

* **Any Architecture** - Server-side rendering, edge-side rendering, client-side rendering, etc.
* **Any Framework** - Vanilla AEM, or any third-party framework like React, Next.js, Angular, etc.
* **Any Hosting** - Can be hosted locally to AEM, or on a remote domain

### Any Content {#any-content}

A content author should have the same powerful editing experience formerly offered by the AEM page editor. But the Universal Editor allows content authors to edit **any** content visually and in-context and supports:

* **AEM Page Structures** - Nested `cq:Components` of `cq:Pages`, including Experience Fragments
* **AEM Content Fragments** - Edit content from Content Fragments as they appear in-context of the experience
* **Documents** - Word, Excel, Google Docs, Markdown, or even plain HTML persisted, for example, on GitHub
* **3rd Party Content** - A plug-in system allows making any external content source editable.

### Any Aspect {#any-aspect}

For a content author, content is not just about the information contained, but how it is rendered ane received. Content comes with additional meta-data and instrumentation rules, which the Universal Editor can understand and edit including:

* **Applying Layout &amp; Style** - By using a style system, the marketing practitioner and content author can apply different styles to their content and create different layouts such as columns, carousels, tabs, accordions, etc.
* **Performing Experimentation** - By publishing a new content version that challenges the existing content, the marketing practitioner can experiment with content improvements and measure the impact.
* **Personalizing Variations** - By creating and managing content variations that are specific for given audiences, marketing practitioners can personalize the content that is delivered.

## Value {#value}

By decoupling the content editing experience from any particular content delivery system, the editor becomes truly universal and flexible allowing the content author to delivery exceptional experiences, increase content velocity, and provides a state-of-the-art developer experience.

* **Deliver Exceptional Experiences** - In order to enable practitioners to create a compelling experience for visitors, the Universal Editor allows practitioners to create and edit the content in the context of the preview. This allows them to create content that fits the design of the experience and that constitutes a meaningful journey for visitors.
* **Increase Content Velocity** - To streamline the management workflow of practitioners, the Universal Editor allows editing content within the preview to guide practitioners by showing only the options that are relevant to that context and makes the workflow independent from the content sources.
* **State-of-the-art Developer Experience** - To support real-world heterogeneous application landscape, the Universal Editor is completely fully decoupled and technology-agnostic, allowing developers to use their preferred technology stack to implement the experience.

## Universal Editor and the Content Fragment Editor {#universal-editor-content-fragment-editor}

At first glance, it might seem like the Universal Editor and the Content Fragment Editor provide similar editing capabilities. However, these editors offer very different capabilities and they accomplish different jobs of the marketing practitioner.

### Content Fragment Editor {#content-fragment-editor} 

A marketing practitioner wants to create content without having to care about its layout, so that it can be reused in numerous contexts of the experience.

* The underlying job to accomplish is to scale the content strategy.

### Universal Editor {#universal-editor}

A marketing practitioner wants to create content that is tailored to the layout of a given context to deliver an exceptional experience.

* The underlying job to accomplish is to convincingly connect with the readers.

## Road Map {#road-map}

It is important to note that the Universal Editor is a work in progress and the capabilities laid out in this document are a vision of the final editor and not necessarily of its current capabilities.
