# Universal Editor Events {#events}

Learn about the different events that the Universal Editor sends that you can use to react to content or UI changes in your remote app.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Applications can have different requirements for page or component updates. Therefore, the Universal Editor sends defined events to remote applications. In case the remote application has no custom event listener for the sent event, a [fallback event listener](#fallback-listeners) provided by the `universal-editor-cors` package is executed.

All events are invoked on the affected DOM element of the remote page. Events bubble up to the `BODY` element where the default event listener provided by the `universal-editor-cors` package is registered. There are events for the content and events for the UI.

All events follow a naming convention.

* `aue:<content-or-ui>-<event-name>`

For example, `aue:content-update` and `aue:ui-select`

Events include the request's and response's payload and are triggered once the corresponding call is successful. For further details about calls and examples of their payloads, please see the document [Universal Editor Calls.](/help/implementing/universal-editor/calls.md)

## Content Update Events {#content-events}

### aue:content-add {#content-add}

The `aue:content-add` event is triggered when a new component is added to a container.

The payload is content from the Universal Editor service, with fallback content from the component definition.

```json
{
    details: {
        request: request payload;   // what is sent to the service
        response: {                 // what is returned by the service
            resource: string;       // newly created content resource
            updates: [{
                resource: string;   // resource to update
                type: string;       // type of instrumentation
                content?: string;   // content to replace
            }]
        }
    }
}
```

### aue:content-details {#content-details}

The `aue:content-details` event is triggered when a component is loaded in the properties rail.

The payload is the component's content and optionally its schema.

```json
{
    details: {
        content: object             // content object
        model: [object]             // model object
        request: request payload;   // what is sent to the service
        response: response payload; // what is returned by the service
    }
}
```

### aue:content-move {#content-move}

The `aue:content-move` event is triggered when a component is moved.

The payload is the component, source container, and target container.

```json
{
    details: {
        from: string;                   // container we move the component from
        component: string;              // component we move
        to: string;                     // container we move the component to
        before: string;                    // before which component shall we place the component
        request: request payload;       // what is sent to the service
        response: response payload;     // what is returned by the service
    }
}
```

### aue:content-patch {#content-patch}

The `aue:content-patch` event is triggered when a component's data is updated in properties rail.

The payload is a JSON patch of the updated properties.

```json
{
    details: {
        patch: {
            name: string;               // attribute which is updated
            value: string;              // new value which is stored to the attribute
        },
        request: request payload;       // what is sent to the service
        response: response payload;     // what is returned by the service
    }
}
```

### aue:content-remove {#content-remove}

The `aue:content-remove` event is triggered when a component is removed from a container.

The payload is the item ID of the removed component.

```json
{
    details: {
        resource: string;               // the resource which got removed
        request: request payload;       // what is sent to the service
        response: response payload;     // what is returned by the service
    }
}
```

### aue:content-update {#content-update}

The `aue:content-update` event is triggered when the properties of a component are updated in-context.

The payload is the updated value.

```json
{
    details: {
        value: string;                  // updated value
        request: request payload;       // what is sent to the service
        response: response payload;     // what is returned by the service 
    }
