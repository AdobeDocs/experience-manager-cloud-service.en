# API Reference Materials {#api-reference-materials}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) provides many APIs for developing applications and extending AEM. AEM is built on top of a number of open-source technologies, which can also be leveraged.

## AEM Core APIs {#core-aem-apis}

The following APIs are core to AEM.

|API|Description|
|---|---|
|[Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service](https://www.adobe.io/experience-manager/reference-materials/cloud-service/javadoc/index.html)|Product abstractions such as pages, assets, workflows, etc.|
|[Granite UI](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/granite-ui/api/jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/index.html#)|Adobe’s Open Web stack, providing various essential components (Note that the 6.5 Granite materials apply to AEMaaCS)|
|[Coral UI](https://opensource.adobe.com/coral-spectrum/documentation/)|Adobe’s visual style for cloud UIs, designed to provide consistency in the user experience|

<!---
|Editor core JavaScript API reference|Provides all the base objects and concepts to support authoring of content resources|

## Additional Frameworks {#additional-apis}

AEM relies on a number of additional open-source APIs.

|API|Description|
|---|---|
|[Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org/apidocs/sling11/)|Web framework that uses a Java Content Repository (JCR) to store and manage content|
|[Apache Jackrabbit Oak](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/oak_api/overview.html)|Implementation a scalable and high-performance hierarchical Java Content Repository (JCR) for use as the foundation of modern world-class web sites|
|[Java Content Repository](https://www.adobe.io/experience-manager/reference-materials/spec/javax.jcr/javadocs/jcr-2.0/index.html)|Specification for the JCR Version 2.0|
|[Apache Felix](https://felix.apache.org)|Implementation of the Open Services Gateway initiative (OSGi) framework and service platform|

## API Preference Guidelines {#guidelines}

AEM is built on the following four primary Java API sets in descending order of preference.

|Priority|API|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|[Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service](https://www.adobe.io/experience-manager/reference-materials/cloud-service/javadoc/index.html)|Product abstractions such as pages, assets, workflows, etc.|
|2|[Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org/apidocs/sling11/)|REST and resource-based abstractions such as resources, value maps, and HTTP requests.|
|3|[Apache Jackrabbit Oak](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/oak_api/overview.html)|Data and content abstractions such as node, properties and sessions.|
|4|[Apache Felix](https://felix.apache.org/)|OSGi application container abstractions such as services and (OSGi) components.|

If an API is provided by AEM, prefer it over Sling, JCR, and OSGi. If AEM doesn’t provide an API, then prefer Sling over JCR and OSGi.
