# AEM Project Repository Structure Package

Maven projects for Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service require a repository structure sub-package definition whose sole purpose is to define the JCR repository roots in which the project's code sub-packages deploy into. This ensures the installation of packages in Experience Manager as a Cloud Service is automatically ordered by JCR resource dependencies. Missing dependencies may lead to scenarios where sub-structures would be installed ahead of their parent structures and therefore be unexpectedly removed, breaking the deployment.

If your code package deploys into a location **not covered** by the code package, then any ancestor resources (JCR resources closer to the JCR root) must be enumerated in the repository structure package to establish these dependencies.

![Repository Structure Package](./assets/repository-structure-packages.png)

The repository structure package defines the expected, common state of `/apps` which the package validator uses to determine areas "safe from potential conflicts" as they are standard roots.

The most typical paths to include in the repository structure package are:

+ `/apps` which is a system-provided node
+ `/apps/cq/...`, `/apps/dam/...`, `/apps/wcm/...`, and `/apps/sling/...` which provide common overlays for `/libs`.
+ `/apps/settings` which is the shared context-aware configuration root path

Note that this sub-package **does not have** any content and is comprised solely of a `pom.xml` defining the filter roots.

## Creating the Repository Structure Package

To create a repository structure package for you Maven project, create a new empty Maven sub-project, with the following `pom.xml`, updating the project metadata to conform with your parent Maven project.

Update the `<filters>` to include all the JCR repository path roots your code packages deploy into.

Make sure to add this new Maven sub-project to the parent projects `<modules>` list.

                    <cloudManagerTarget>none</cloudManagerTarget>

                        Overlays of /libs typically require defining the overlayed structure, at each level here.

                        For example, adding a new section to the main AEM Tools navigation, necessitates the following rules:

                        <filter><root>/apps/cq</root></filter>
                        <filter><root>/apps/cq/core</root></filter>
                        <filter><root>/apps/cq/core/content</root></filter>
                        <filter><root>/apps/cq/core/content/nav/</root></filter>
                        <filter><root>/apps/cq/core/content/nav/tools</root></filter>


                        Any /apps level Context-aware configurations need to enumerated here. 
                        
                        For example, providing email templates under `/apps/settings/notification-templates/com.day.cq.replication` necessitates the following rules:

                        <filter><root>/apps/settings</root></filter>
                        <filter><root>/apps/settings/notification-templates</root></filter>
                        <filter><root>/apps/settings/notification-templates/com.day.cq.replication</root></filter>
                        -->

                    </filters>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

## Referencing the Repository Structure Package

To use the repository structure package, reference it via all code package (the sub-packages that deploy to `/apps`) Maven projects via the FileVault content package Maven plug-ins `<repositoryStructurePackage>` configuration.

In the `ui.apps/pom.xml`, and any other code package `pom.xml`s, add a reference to the project's repository structure package (#repository-structure-package) configuration to the FileVault package Maven plug-in.

```xml
...
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.jackrabbit</groupId>
      <artifactId>filevault-package-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <extensions>true</extensions>
      <configuration>
        ...
        <repositoryStructurePackages>
          <repositoryStructurePackage>
              <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
              <artifactId>ui.apps.structure</artifactId>
              <version>${project.version}</version>
          </repositoryStructurePackage>
        </repositoryStructurePackages>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
    ...
</build>
<dependencies>
    <!-- Add the dependency for the repository structure package so it resolves -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>ui.apps.structure</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <type>zip</type>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```

## Multi-Code Package Use Case

A less common, and more complex use-case, is supporting the deployment of multiple code packages that install into the same areas of the JCR repository.

For example:

+ Code package A deploys into `/apps/a`
+ Code package B deploys into `/apps/a/b`

If a package-level dependency is not established from code package B on code package A, code package B may deploy first into `/apps/a`, followed by code package B, which deploys into `/apps/a`, resulting in a removal of the previously installed `/apps/a/b`.

In this case:

+ Code package A should define a `<repositoryStructurePackage>` on the project's repository structure package (which should have a filter for `/apps`).
+ Code package B should define a `<repositoryStructurePackage>` on code package A, because code package B deploys into space shared by code package A.

## Errors and Debugging

If the repository structure packages are not set-up correctly, at Maven build an error will be reported:

```
1 error(s) detected during dependency analysis.
Filter root's ancestor '/apps/some/path' is not covered by any of the specified dependencies.
```

This indicates the breaking code package does not have a `<repositoryStructurePackage>` that lists `/apps/some/path` in its filter list.
