# AEM Node Types {#aem-node-types}

Because AEM is based on Sling and uses a JCR repository, node types offered by both of these standards are available for use in AEM:

* [JCR Node Types](https://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/spec/jcr/2.0/3_Repository_Model.html#3.1.7-Node-Types)
* [Sling Node Types](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SLING/Sling+Node+Types)

In addition to these. AEM provides a range of custom node types. For the most current list with all associated properties, [use CRXDE](/help/implementing/developing/tools/crxde.md) to browse the following path in the AEM repository:

`/jcr:system/jcr:nodeTypes`
