# Introduction {#introduction}

Some architectures rely on making calls to AEM as a Cloud Service from an application hosted on a server outside of AEM infrastructure. For example, a mobile application that calls a server, which then makes API requests to AEM as a Cloud Service.

The server-to-server flow is described below, along with a simplified flow for development. The AEM as a Cloud Service [Developer Console](development-guidelines.md#crxde-lite-and-developer-console) is used to generate tokens needed for the authentication process.

## The Server-to-server Flow {#the-server-to-server-flow}

A user with an IMS org administrator role, and who is also a member of the AEM Users or AEM Administrators Product Profile on AEM Author, can generate an AEM as a Cloud Service credential. That credential can subsequently be retrieved by a user with the AEM as a Cloud Service Environment administrator role and should be installed on the server and needs be treated carefully as a secret key. This JSON format file contains all the data required to integrate with an AEM as a Cloud Service API. The data is used to create a signed JWT token, which is exchanged with IMS for an IMS access token. This access token can then be used as a Bearer authentication token to make requests to AEM as a Cloud Service. The credentials expire after one year by default, but they can be refreshed when needed, as described [here](#refresh-credentials).

The server-to-server flow involves the following steps:

* Fetch the AEM as a Cloud Service credentials from the Developer Console
* Install the AEM as a Cloud Service credentials on a non AEM server making calls to AEM
* Generate a JWT token and exchange that token for an access token using Adobe's IMS APIs
* Calling the AEM API with the access token as a Bearer Authentication token
* Set appropriate permissions for the technical account user in the AEM environment

### Fetch the AEM as a Cloud Service Credentials {#fetch-the-aem-as-a-cloud-service-credentials}

Users with access to the AEM as a Cloud Service developer console will see the integrations tab in the Developer Console for a given environment, as well as two buttons. A user with the AEM as a Cloud Service Environment administrator role can click the **Generate Service Credentials** button to generate and display the service credentials json, which will contain all the information required for the non AEM server, including client id, client secret, private key, certificate, and configuration for author and publish tiers of the environment, regardless of the pod selection.

The output will be similar to the following:

```
{
  "ok": true,
  "integration": {
    "imsEndpoint": "ims-na1.adobelogin.com",
    "metascopes": "ent_aem_cloud_sdk,ent_cloudmgr_sdk",
    "technicalAccount": {
      "clientId": "cm-p123-e1234",
      "clientSecret": "4AREDACTED17"
    },
    "email": "abcd@techacct.adobe.com",
    "id": "ABCDAE10A495E8C@techacct.adobe.com",
    "org": "1234@AdobeOrg",
    "privateKey": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\r\REDACTED\r\n==\r\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n",
    "publicKey": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\nREDACTED\r\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n"
  },
  "statusCode": 200
}
```

After being generated, the credentials can be retrieved at a later date by pressing the **Get Service Credentials** button in the same location.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>An IMS org administrator (typically the same user who provisioned the environment via Cloud Manager), who should also be member of the AEM Users or AEM Administrators Product Profile on AEM Author, must first access the Developer Console and click the **Generate Service Credentials** button in order for the credentials to be generated and later retrieved by a user with admin permissions to the AEM as a Cloud Service environment. If the IMS org administrator has not done this, a message will inform them that they need the IMS org Administrator role.

### Install the AEM Service Credentials on a Non AEM Server {#install-the-aem-service-credentials-on-a-non-aem-server}

The non-AEM application making calls to AEM should be able to access the AEM as a Cloud Service credentials, treating it as a secret.

### Generate a JWT Token and Exchange It for an Access Token {#generate-a-jwt-token-and-exchange-it-for-an-access-token}

Use the credentials to create a JWT token in a call to Adobe's IMS service in order to retrieve an access token, which is valid for 24 hours.

The AEM CS Service Credentials may be exchanged for an access token using client libraries designed for this purpose. The client libraries are available from [Adobe's public GitHub repository](https://github.com/adobe/aemcs-api-client-lib), which contains more detailed guidance and latest information.

```
/*jshint node:true */
"use strict";

const fs = require('fs');
const exchange = require("@adobe/aemcs-api-client-lib");

const jsonfile = "aemcs-service-credentials.json";

var config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(jsonfile, 'utf8'));
exchange(config).then(accessToken => {
    // output the access token in json form including when it will expire.
    console.log(JSON.stringify(accessToken,null,2));
}).catch(e => {
    console.log("Failed to exchange for access token ",e);
});
```

The same exchange can be performed in any language capable of generating a signed JWT Token with the correct format and calling the IMS Token Exchange APIs.

The access token will define when it expires, which is typically 24 hours. There is sample code in the git repository to manage an access token and refresh it before it expires.

### Calling the AEM API {#calling-the-aem-api}

Make the appropriate server-to-server API calls to an AEM as a Cloud Service environment, including the access token in the header. So for the "Authorization" header, use the value `"Bearer <access_token>"`. For example, using `curl`:

```curlc
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_ims_access_token>" https://author-p123123-e23423423.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam.json
```

### Set the Appropriate Permissions for the Technical Account User in AEM {#set-the-appropriate-permissions-for-the-technical-account-user-in-aem}

Once the technical account user is created in AEM (this occurs after the first request with the corresponding access token), the technical account user must be properly permissioned **in** AEM.

Note that by default, on the AEM Author service, the technical account user is added to the Contributors user group which provides read access AEM.

This technical account user in AEM can be further provisioned with permissions using the usual methods.

## Developer Flow {#developer-flow}

Developers will likely want to test using a development instance of their non-AEM application (either running on their laptop or hosted) that makes requests to a development AEM as a Cloud Service dev environment. However, since developers do not necessarily have IMS admin role permissions, we cannot assume they can generate the JWT bearer described in the regular server-to-server flow. Thus, we provide a mechanism for a developer to generate an access token directly that can be used in requests to AEM as a Cloud Service environments which they have access to. 

See the [Developer Guidelines documentation](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/development-guidelines.md#crxde-lite-and-developer-console) for information about the required permissions to use the AEM as a Cloud Service developer console.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The local development access token is valid for a maximum of 24 hours after which it must be regenerated using the same method.

Developers may use this token to make calls from their non-AEM test application to an AEM as a Cloud Service environment. Typically, the developer will use this token with the non-AEM application on their own laptop. Also, the AEM as a Cloud is typically a non-production environment.

The developer flow involves the following steps:

* Generate an access token from the Developer Console
* Call the AEM application with the access token.

Developers can also make API calls to an AEM project running on their local machine, in which case an access token is not needed.

### Generating the Access Token {#generating-the-access-token}

Click the **Get Local Development Token** button in the Developer Console to generate an access token.

### Call then AEM Application with an Access Token {#call-the-aem-application-with-an-access-token}

Make the appropriate server-to-server API calls from the non-AEM application to an AEM as a Cloud Service environment, including the access token in the header. So for the "Authorization" header, use the value `"Bearer <access_token>"`.

## Refresh Credentials {#refresh-credentials}

By default, the AEM as a Cloud Service credentials expire after a year. To ensure service continuity, developers have the option of refreshing the credentials, extending their availability for an extra year.

To achieve this, you can use the **Refresh Service Credentials** button from the **Integrations** tab in the Developer Console, as shown below.

![Credential Refresh](assets/credential-refresh.png)

After pressing the button, a new set of credentials will be generated. You can update your secret storage with the new credentials and validate that they work as they should.

>[!NOTE]
>
> After clicking the **Refresh Service Credentials** button, the old credentials remain registered until they expire, but only the most recent set is available to be seen from the Developer Console at any one time.

## Service Credentials Revocation {#service-credentials-revocation}

If the credentials need to be revoked, you need to submit a request to customer support using these steps:

1. Disable the technical account user for the Adobe Admin Console in the User Interface:
   * In Cloud Manager, press the **...** button next to your environment. This will open the product profiles page
   * Now, click on the **AEM Users** profile, to show a list of the users
   * Click the **API Credentials** tab, then find the appropriate technical account user and delete it
2. Contact customer support, and request that the service credentials for that specific environment are deleted
3. Finally, you can generate the credentials again, as described in this documentation. Also make sure that the new technical account user that is created has the appropriate permissions.
