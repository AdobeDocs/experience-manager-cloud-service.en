# Java API Guidelines {#java-api-guidelines}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is built on a rich open-source software stack that exposes many Java APIs for use during development.

AEM is built on the following four primary Java API sets in descending order of preference.

1. **[Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-cloud-service-javadoc/index.html)** - Product abstractions such as pages, assets, workflows, etc.
1. **[Apache Sling Web Framework](https://sling.apache.org/apidocs/sling11/)** - REST and resource-based abstractions such as resources, value maps, and HTTP requests.
1. **[JCR (Apache Jackrabbit Oak)](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/oak_api/overview.html)** - Data and content abstractions such as node, properties and sessions.
1. **[OSGi (Apache Felix)](https://felix.apache.org)** - OSGi application container abstractions such as services and (OSGi) components.

If an API is provided by AEM, prefer it over Sling, JCR, and OSGi. If AEM doesnâ€™t provide an API, then prefer Sling over JCR and OSGi.

For details of these guidelines, see the document [Understand Java API Best Practices.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/foundation/development/understand-java-api-best-practices.html)
