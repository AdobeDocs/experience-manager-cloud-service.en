# Quick Site Creation and Front-End Customization {#quick-site-creation}

Learn how the Quick Site Creation tool uses site templates, themes, and the front-end pipeline to enable fast deployment of new sites and decouple front-end development.

## Overview {#overview}

The Quick Site Creation tool is an easy-to-use tool that allows administrators to quickly deploy new sites that front-end developers can immediately begin to customize independent of back-end development and site content creation.

To do this, the Quick Site Creation tool uses several powerful AEM as a Cloud Service features:

1. **AEM Site Templates** are used to define base site content and structure as well as site styling and are selected by an administrator when creating a new site.
1. An **AEM Site Theme** is included in the template and contains the CSS, JavaScript, and static resources that define the styling of the site.
1. The **Front-End Pipeline** can be used to deploy customizations to the site theme independently of back-end development.
