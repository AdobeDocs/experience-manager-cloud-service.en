# The Content Copy Tool {#content-copy}

The content copy tool enables users to copy mutable content on-demand from their production environments on AEM as a Cloud Service to lower environments for testing purposes.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Current, real data is valuable for testing, validation, and user-acceptance purposes. The content copy tool lets you copy content from a production AEM as a Cloud Service environment to a staging, development, or [Rapid Development Environment (RDE)](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/rapid-development-environments.md) environment for such testing.

The content to copy is defined by a content set. A content set consists of a list of JCR paths that contain the mutable content to be copied from a source authoring service environment to a target authoring service environment within the same Cloud Manager program. The following paths are permitted in a content set.

```text
/content
/conf/**/settings/wcm
/conf/**/settings/dam/cfm/models
/conf/**/settings/graphql/persistentQueries
/etc/clientlibs/fd/themes
```

When copying content, the source environment is the source of truth.

* If content has been modified in the destination environment, it is overwritten by content in the source, if the paths are the same.
* If the paths are different, content from the source is merged with the content in the destination.

## Permissions {#permissions}

To use the content copy tool, certain permissions are required in both the source and target environments.

| Content Copy Feature | AEM Administrator Group | Deployment Manager Role |
|---|---|---|
| Create and modify [content sets](#create-content-set) | Not Required | Required |
| Start or cancel the [content copy process](#copy-content) | Required | Required |

For more details on permissions and how to set them, see [AEM as a Cloud Service Team and Product Profiles](/help/onboarding/aem-cs-team-product-profiles.md).

## Creating a Content Set {#create-content-set}

Before any content can be copied, a content set must be defined. After it is defined, content sets can be reused to copy content. Follow these steps so you can create a content set.

1. Log on to Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization and program.

1. Navigate to the **Environments** screen from the **Overview** page.

1. Navigate to the **Content Sets** page from the **Environments** screen.

1. At the top-right of the screen, click **Add Content Set**.

   ![Content Sets](assets/content-sets.png)

1. On the **Details** tab of the wizard, provide a name and description for the content set and select **Continue**.

   ![Content set details](assets/add-content-set-details.png)

1. On the **Content Paths** tab of the wizard, specify the paths of the mutable content to be included in the content set.

   1. Enter the path in the **Add Include Path** field.
   1. Click **Add Path** to add the path to the content set.
   1. Click **Add Path** again as necessary.
      * Up to 50 paths are allowed.

   ![Add paths to content set](assets/add-content-set-paths.png)

1. If you must refine or restrict your content set, subpaths can be excluded.

   1. In the list of included paths, click **Add exclude sub-paths** next to the path you want to restrict.
   1. Enter the subpath to exclude beneath the selected path.
   1. Select **Exclude Path**.
   1. Select **Add exclude sub-paths** again to add additional paths to exclude as necessary.
      * Excluded paths must be relative to the included path.
      * There is no limit on the number of excluded paths.

   ![Excluding paths](assets/add-content-set-paths-excluded.png)

1. You can edit the specified paths, if necessary.

   1. Click the X next to excluded subpaths so you can delete them.
   1. Click the ellipsis button next to paths so you can reveal **Edit** and **Delete** options.

   ![Editing path list](assets/add-content-set-excluded-paths.png)

1. Select **Create** to create the content set.

The content set can now be used to copy content between environments.

## Editing a Content Set {#edit-content-set}

Follow similar steps as when creating a content step. Instead of clicking **Add Content Set**, select an existing set from the console, and select **Edit** from the ellipsis menu.

![Edit content set](assets/edit-content-set.png)

When editing your content set, you can expand the configured paths to reveal the excluded subpaths.

## Copying Content {#copy-content}

After a content set is created, you can use it to copy content. Follow these steps so you can copy content.

>[!NOTE]
> Do not use Content Copy on an environment while a [content transfer](/help/journey-migration/content-transfer-tool/using-content-transfer-tool/overview-content-transfer-tool.md) operation is running on that environment. 

1. Log into Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization and program.

1. Navigate to the **Environments** screen from the **Overview** page.

1. Navigate to the **Content Sets** page from the **Environments** screen.

1. Select a content set from the console and select **Copy Content** from the ellipsis menu.

   ![Content copy](assets/copy-content.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >An environment may not be selectable if:
   >
   >* The user does not have the appropriate permissions.
   >* The environment has a running pipeline or a copy content operation in progress.
   >* The environment is hibernating or starting up.

1. In the **Copy content** dialog, specify the source and destination for your content copy action.

   ![Copying content](assets/copying-content.png)

   * Content can only be copied from a higher environment to a lower environment or between development/RDE environments where the hierarchy of environments is as follows (from highest to lowest):
     * Production
     * Staging
     * Development / RDE

1. If necessary, you can also elect to **Include Access Control Lists** in your copy process.

1. Select **Copy**.

The copy process starts. The status of the copy process is reflected in the console for the selected content set.

## Content Copy Activity {#copy-activity}

You can monitor the status of your copy processes in the **Copy Content Activity** page.

1. Log into Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization and program.

1. Navigate to the **Environments** screen from the **Overview** page.

1. Navigate to the **Copy Content Activity** page from the **Environments** screen.

### Content Copy Statuses {#statuses}

Once you start copying content, the process can have one of the following statuses.

|Status|Description|
|---|---|
|In progress|Content copy operation is ongoing|
|Failed|Content copy operation failed|
|Completed|Content copy operation completed successfully|
|Canceled|User cancels a content copy operation after starting it|

### Canceling a Copy Process {#canceling}

If you must abort a content copy operation after starting it, you can optionally cancel it.

To do so, on the **Copy Content Activity** page, select the **Cancel** action from the ellipsis menu of the copy process you previously started.

![Cancel content copy](assets/content-copy-cancel.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you cancel a content copy operation, it can result in a partial copy of the content in the destination environment. This situation can leave the destination environment in an unusable state.
>
>If your environment is in such a state due to cancellation, contact Adobe Customer Care for assistance.

### Accessing Logs {#accessing-logs}

You can check the logs for both the source and destination environments for any completed content copy process.

To do so, on the **Copy Content Activity** page, select the **Logs** action from the ellipsis menu of the copy process for which you would like to review the logs and then choose for which environment.

![Accessing logs for copy content process](assets/copy-content-logs.png)

The logs are downloaded to your local machine. If the download does not commence, check your pop-up blocker settings.

## Limitations {#limitations}

The content copy tool has the following limitations.

* Content cannot be copied from a lower environment to a higher environment.
* Content can only be copied from and to authoring services.
* Cross-program content copy is not possible.
* Running concurrent content copy operations on the same environment is not possible.
* Up to 50 paths can be specified per content set. There is no limitation on excluded paths.
* Do not use the content copy tool as a cloning or mirroring tool because it cannot track moved or deleted content on the source.
* The content copy tool has no versioning capability and cannot automatically detect modified content or created content on the source environment in a content set since the last content copy operation.
  * If you want to update your destination environment with content changes only, since the last content copy operation, you must create a content set. Then, specify the paths on the source instance where changes were made since the last content copy operation.
* Version information is not included in a content copy.
