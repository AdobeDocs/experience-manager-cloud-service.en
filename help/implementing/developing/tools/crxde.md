## Overview of the User Interface {#overview-of-the-user-interface}

CRXDE Lite's user interface has many parts and has many functions.

### Top switcher bar {#top-switcher-bar}

The Top Switcher Bar allows you to quickly switch between CRXDE Lite and [Package Manager.](package-manager.md)

The Node Path Widget displays the path to the currently selected node.

You can also use it to jump to a node by entering the path by hand or pasting it from somewhere else and pressing Enter.

It also provides support for looking for nodes with specific node name. Enter the name of the node you would like to find, and wait (or select the search icon on the right-hand side). If a given node or nodes is loaded into the explorer pane, the list will be displayed, and you can select the path and press Enter to navigate to it. Note that it only works for the nodes currently loaded into the CRXDE client application in browser. If you want to search the whole repository, use **Tools** -&gt: **Query**.

### Explorer Pane {#explorer-pane}

The **Explorer Pane** displays a tree of all the nodes in the repository.

Click a node to display its properties in the **Properties** tab. After clicking a node, you can select an action in the toolbar. Click the node again to rename it.

Tree Navigation Filter (the binoculars icon) enables you to filter the nodes in the repository for which the name contains the input text. It only applies to nodes that have been loaded locally.

### Edit Pane {#edit-pane}

The **Edit Pane** allows you to view the content of the currently-selected file in the repository. Each file opened will be represented as its own tab in the pane.

The **Properties Tab** displays the properties of the node that you have selected. You can add new properties or delete existing ones.

### Access Control Tab {#access-control-tab}

The **Access Control Tab** displays permissions based on the current path, repository, or principal.

The permissions are broken down into the following categories.

* **Applicable Access Control Policy** - The policies that can be applied to the current selection
* **Local Access Control Policies** - The current policies applied locally to the current selection
* **Effective Access Control Policies** - The current policies applied for the current selection, which might be set locally or inherited from parent nodes
