# AEM Repo Tool {#aem-repo-tool}

The AEM Repo Tool is a simple solution to transfer JCR content between your local filesystem and the AEM server via the command line comparable to FTP. The AEM Repo Tool is similar to the [Jackrabbit FileVault Maven plugin](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault-package-maven-plugin), but is faster, has minimal dependencies, and is a simple bash script.

This tool simplifies the transfer of files for the developer and also can be integrated into Eclipse and IntelliJ to make development even more efficient.

## Overview {#overview}

For a given path inside a `jcr_root` FileVault structure on the filesystem, the AEM Repo Tool creates a package with a single filter for the entire subtree and pushes that to the server (similar to FTP `put`), fetches it from the server ( `get`) or compares the differences ( `status` and `diff`).

The tool does not support multiple filter paths or FileVault's `filter.xml`.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Please note that the AEM Repo Tool will always overwrite the entire file or directory specified.
