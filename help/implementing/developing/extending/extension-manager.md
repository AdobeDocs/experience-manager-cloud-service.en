# Extensions and the Extension Manager {#extensions-and-the-extension-manager}

The Extension Manager in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service enables developers and practitioners to enhance the functionality of AEM using UI extensions built with the Adobe App Builder.

With the Extension Manager, you can:

* enable or disable extensions on a per-instance basis
* configure extension parameters
* preview extensions and generate a shareable preview link
* discover UI extensibility features via interactive demos
* access Adobeâ€™s experimental features through first-party extensions
