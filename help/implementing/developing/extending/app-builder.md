# Extending [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service using Adobe Developer App Builder {#extend-using-app-builder}

## What is App Builder for AEM as a Cloud Service {#project-firefly}

The new Adobe Developer App Builder provides an extensibility framework for a developer to easily extend AEM as a Cloud Service functionalities. 

App Builder helps customers work within their existing infrastructure to build integrations and custom applications that work seamlessly with AEM. With a modern, cloud-native technology stack, App Builder provides a set of APIs to extend AEM, into customers’ existing infrastructure and apply unique parameters to make the UI look and feel unique for their organizations.

## Architecture {#architecture}

Instead of an out-of-the-box solution, Adobe Developer App Builder provides a common, consistent, standardized development platform for extending Adobe Cloud solutions such as AEM including​:

* A cloud native development stack
* A unified Development framework across AEM applications which provides a consistent developer experience to accelerate integrations, innovate experiences and customizations
* To achieve Software as a Service (SaaS) like upgradability reducing maintenance/upgrade costs
* To provide prebuilt extensions and integrations on Adobe.io.

The following diagram illustrates how App Builder fits into the development stack.
