# AEM Headless Developer Journey {#aem-headless-developer-journey}

>[!CAUTION]

>OUTDATED - This draft content has been superseded by the new [Headless Developer Journey documentation.](/help/journey-headless/developer/overview.md)

Start here for a guided journey through the powerful and flexible headless features of AEM, their capabilities, and how to leverage them on your first headless development project.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Headless implementation is increasingly becoming important for delivering experiences to your audience, wherever they are and regardless of channel.

Headless implementation forgoes page and component management as is traditional in full stack solutions and focuses on the creation of channel-neutral, reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery. It is a modern and dynamic development pattern for implementing web experiences.

This guide leads you through the most important topics so that on completion you:

* Have a full understanding of what headless content delivery is and its benefits.
* Understand AEM's headless features and how they work together to deliver a headless experience.
* Have the ability to take the first steps implementing your first AEM headless project.

## Audience {#audience}

This journey is designed for the developer persona, laying out the requirements, steps, and approach of an AEM Headless project from a developer's perspective. The journey will define additional personas with which the developer must interact for a successful project, but the point-of-view for the journey is that of the developer.

Information in this journey can of course be useful to other personas, but some information will be superfluous to certain roles. Stay tuned for forthcoming journeys covering additional roles.

## The Headless Developer Journey {#the-journey}

You will explore many topics in this journey. The following articles give you foundational knowledge of headless in AEM and link out to detailed technical documentation.

Although you can go directly to a particular part of the journey, many concepts build on ones in previous articles. Therefore if you are new to headless in AEM, we recommend that you start at the beginning and progress sequentially.

## What's Next {#what-is-next}

You are now ready to get started on your Adobe Headless journey. We encourage you to continue on to the next part of the journey and read the article [Learn about CMS Headless Development.](learn-about.md)

### Choose Your Own Adventure {#choose-your-path}

However, Adobe wants you to succeed as you get started with your AEM Headless project, regardless of your learning style. So please consider these two options.

* If you prefer to continue to **learn about headless concepts and AEM's headless technologies**, you should continue your AEM headless journey as recommended by next reviewing the document [How to Model Your Content as AEM Content Models](model-your-content.md) where you learn how to model your content structure in AEM.
* If you prefer to **learn by doing**, you can jump to the [Getting Started with AEM Headless hands-on tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/graphql/multi-step/overview.html) where you will jump directly into AEM Headless development by implementing a simple project to expose AEM headless content.
