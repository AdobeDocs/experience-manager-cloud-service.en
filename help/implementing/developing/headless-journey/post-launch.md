In this part of the [AEM Headless Developer Journey,](overview.md) learn how to maintain your headless experience.

## The Story So Far {#story-so-far}

In the previous document of the AEM headless journey, [How to Go Live with Your Headless Application](go-live.md) you learned how to take your headless experience live and you should now:

* Understand AEM Content Replication and Caching Basics
* Know how to configure the tooling required to simulate go live for your headless application
* Know how to secure and Scale your application before Launch
* Understand how to Monitor Performance and Debug Issues

This article builds on those fundamentals so you understand how to maintain your project after going live.

## What's Next {#what-is-next}

Congratulations! You have completed the AEM Headless Developer Journey! You should now have an understanding of:

* The difference between headless and headful content delivery.
* AEM's headless features.
* How to organize and AEM Headless project.
* How to create headless content in AEM.
* How to retrieve and update headless content in AEM.
* How to go live with an AEM Headless project.
* What do do after the go-live.

You have either already launched your first AEM Headless project or now have all the knowledge you need to do so. Great job!

The headless stores in AEM doesn't need to stop here, though. You might remember in the [Getting Started part of the journey](getting-started.md#integration-levels) we discussed briefly how AEM not only supports headless delivery and traditional full-stack models, but also can support hybrid models that combines the advantages of both.

If this kind of flexibility is something you need for your project, continue on to the optional, additional part of the journey, [How to Create Single Page Applications (SPAs) with AEM.](create-spa.md)
