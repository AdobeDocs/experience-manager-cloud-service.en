# CDN in AEM as a Cloud Service {#cdn}

AEM as Cloud Service is shipped with a built-in CDN. Itâ€™s main purpose is to reduce latency by delivering cacheable content from the CDN nodes at the edge, near the browser. It is fully managed and configured for optimal performance of AEM applications.

In total, AEM offers two options:

1. AEM Managed CDN - AEM's out-of-the-box CDN. It is a tightly integrated option and does not require heavy customer investment in supporting the CDN integration with AEM.
1. Customer Managed CDN points to AEM Managed CDN  - the customer points their own CDN to AEM's out-of-the-box CDN. The customer will still need to manage their own CDN, but investment in the integration with AEM is moderate.

The first option should satisfy most of the customer performance and security requirements. Additionally, it requires minimal customer effort.

The second option will be allowed on a case-by-case basis. The decision is based on meeting certain pre-requisites including, but not limited to, the customer having a legacy integration with their CDN vendor that is difficult to abandon.

Presented below is a decision matrix to compare the two options. More detailed information can be found in the sections that follow.

| Details | AEM Managed CDN | Customer Managed CDN points to AEM CDN |
|---|---|---|
| **Customer effort** | None, it is fully integrated. Only need to point CNAME to AEM Managed CDN.| Moderate customer investment. The customer must manage its own CDN. |
| **Pre-requisites** | None | Existing CDN that is onerous to replace. Must demonstrate a successful load test prior to going live. |
| **CDN expertise** | None | Requires at least one part time engineering resource with detailed CDN knowledge that is capable of configuring the customer's CDN. |
| **Security** | Managed by Adobe. | Managed by Adobe (and optionally by the customer at their own CDN). |
| **Performance** | Optimized by Adobe. | Will benefit from some AEM CDN capabilities, but potentially a small performance hit due to the extra hop. **Note**: Hops from customer CDN to Adobe's out of the box CDN likely to be efficient). |
| **Caching** | Supports cache headers applied at the dispatcher. | Supports cache headers applied at the dispatcher. |
| **Image and video compression capabilities** | Can work with Adobe Dynamic Media. | Can work with Adobe Dynamic Media or customer managed CDN image/video solution. |

## AEM Managed CDN  {#aem-managed-cdn}

Follow these to prepare for content delivery by using Adobe's out-of-the-box CDN:

1. You will provide the signed SSL certificate and secret key to Adobe by sharing a link to a secure form containing this information. Please coordinate with customer support on this task.
**Note:** Aem as a Cloud Service does not support Domain Validated (DV) certificates.
1. You should inform customer support:
   * which custom domain should be associated with a given environment, as defined by the program id and environment id. Note that custom domains on the author side are not supported.
   * if any IP whitelisting is needed to restrict traffic to a given environment.
1. You should coordinate with customer support about timing of the necessary changes to the DNS records. The instructions are different based on whether an apex record is needed:
   * if an apex record is not needed, customers should set the CNAME DNS record to point their FQDN to `cdn.adobeaemcloud.com`.
   * if an apex record is needed, create an A record pointing to the following IPs: 151.101.3.10, 151.101.67.10, 151.101.131.10, 151.101.195.10. Customers need an apex record if the desired FQDN matches the DNS Zone. This can be tested by using the Unix dig command to see if the SOA value of the output matches the domain. For example, the command `dig anything.dev.adobeaemcloud.com` returns a SOA (Start of Authority, i.e., the zone) of `dev.adobeaemcloud.com` so its not an APEX record, while `dig dev.adobeaemcloud.com` returns a SOA of `dev.adobeaemcloud.com` so it is an apex record.
1. You will be notified when the SSL certificates are expiring so you can resubmit the new SSL certificates.

**Restricting traffic**

By default, for an Adobe Managed CDN setup, all public traffic can make its way to the publish service, for both production and non-production (development and stage) environments. If you wish to limit traffic to the publish service for a given environment (for example, limiting staging by a range of IP addresses) you should work with customer support to configure these restrictions. 

## Customer CDN points to AEM Managed CDN {#point-to-point-CDN}

Supported if you want to use your existing CDN, but can't satisfy the requirements of a Customer managed CDN. In this case, you manage your own CDN, but point to Adobe's managed CDN. 

Please be aware that:

1. You must have an existing CDN. 
1. You must manage it.
1. You must be able to configure the CDN to work with Aem as a Cloud Service - see the configuration instructions below.
1. You must have engineering CDN experts that are on call in case related issues arise.
1. You must perform and successfully pass a load test before going to production.

Configuration instructions:

1. Set the `X-Forwarded-Host` header with the domain name.
1. Set Host header with the origin domain, which is Adobe's CDN's ingress. The value should come from Adobe.
1. Send the SNI header to the origin. Like the Host header, the sni header must be the origin domain.
1. Set the `X-Edge-Key`, which is needed to route traffic correctly to the AEM servers. The value should come from Adobe.

Prior to accepting live traffic, you should validate with Adobe customer support that the end-to-end traffic routing is functioning correctly.
