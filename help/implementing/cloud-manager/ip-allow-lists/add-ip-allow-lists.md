1. In the **Add IP Allow List** dialog box, enter a name that you want to use to reference the allowlist in the **IP Allow List name** field.

   * This name is informational only and should be descriptive to help you identify the list.

1. Enter an IP or IP CIDR block in the **IP address/CIDR** field.

   * Multiple blocks can be separated by a comma or a tab.

1. Click **Save**.

After saving, the newly created IP allowlist appears as a row in the table in the **IP Allow Lists** page.
