# Introduction {#introduction}

AEM as a cloud service is open to the internet and security is handled through user authentication and authorization. IP Allow listing is a feature in Cloud Manager used for limiting and controlling access only to trusted users. This feature enables users with permissions to create Allow-lists of trusted IP addresses from which their sites users can access their AEM domains. 

IP Allow lists can be added once and applied/unapplied multiple times as a unit or entity to an Author and/or Publisher service in an environment.

>[!NOTE]
>IP Allow-Lists names are supported in Cloud Manager for Author and/or Publish service in an environment.

Using the Cloud Manager UI IP Allow List page, or the Environment Details page, a user with permissions can perform several tasks to manage IP Allow Lists for your environments, including:

* Adding IP Allow List
    >[!NOTE]
    > You can Add once and reuse or apply the rule any number of times across environment-services in the program.
* Viewing or Updating an IP Allow List 
* Applying or Un-applying an IP Allow List 
* Deleting an IP Allow List
