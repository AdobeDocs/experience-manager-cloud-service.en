## Edge Delivery Services in Brief {#edge-overview}

Edge Delivery Services is a composable set of services that allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author content on your website. This ability lets you do the following:

* Create fast sites with a perfect Lighthouse Score.
* Continuously monitor performance through RUM (Real Use Monitoring).
* Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources.

You can use both AEM content management and WYSIWYG authoring using the Universal Editor and document-based authoring.

Cloud Manager in AEM as a Cloud Service lets you enable Edge Delivery Service for your project.
