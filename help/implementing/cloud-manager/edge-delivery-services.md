## Edge Delivery Services in Brief {#edge-overview}

Edge Delivery Services is a composable set of services that allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author content on your website. This allows you to:

* Create fast sites with a perfect Lighthouse Score and continuously monitor performance through real use monitoring (RUM).
* Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources.

You can use both AEM content management and WYSIWYG authoring using the Universal Editor as well as document-based authoring.

Cloud Manager in AEM as a Cloud Service allows you to enable Edge Delivery Service for your project.

>For details about Edge Delivery Services and how it can be used with AEM, please see the document [Edge Delivery Services Overview.](/help/edge/overview.md)

## Edge Delivery Services in Cloud Manager {#edge-in-cloud-manager}

If you have licensed Edge Delivery Services as part of Adobe Experience Manager Sites, you can onboard your site with Edge Delivery Services directly in Cloud Manager and go live [using a guided, self-service experience.](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/private-repositories.md)

This enables a unified experience for all of your AEM properties, ensuring consistency with all critical workflows including domain name management, SSL certificate management, and CDN mappings.

Edge Delivery Services is available to both [production and sandbox programs.](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/program-types.md)
