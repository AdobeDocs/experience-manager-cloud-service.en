## Edge Delivery Services in Brief {#edge-overview}

Edge Delivery Services is a composable set of services that allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author content on your website. This ability lets you do the following:

* Create fast sites with a perfect Lighthouse Score.
* Continuously monitor performance through RUM (Real Use Monitoring).
* Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources.

You can use both AEM content management and WYSIWYG authoring using the Universal Editor and document-based authoring.

Cloud Manager in AEM as a Cloud Service allows you to enable Edge Delivery Service for your project.

## Edge Delivery Services in Cloud Manager {#edge-in-cloud-manager}

If you have licensed Edge Delivery Services as part of Adobe Experience Manager Sites, you can onboard your site with Edge Delivery Services directly in Cloud Manager and go live [using a guided, self-service experience](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/private-repositories.md).

This functionality delivers a unified experience for managing all your AEM properties. It ensures consistency across key workflows. These include domain name management, SSL certificate management, and CDN mappings.

Edge Delivery Services is available to both [production and sandbox programs](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/program-types.md).
