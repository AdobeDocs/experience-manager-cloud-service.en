## Early Adoption Program {#early-adoption}

For a chance to test some upcoming features, be a part of Adobe's early adoption program.

### Client-Side Collection via Real User Monitoring (RUM) {#rum}

You can leverage the [Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/content-requests.md#cliendside-collection) to enable client-side collection for AEM as a Cloud Service.

Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service offers a more precise reflection of user interactions, ensuring a reliable measure of website engagement. It is a great opportunity to gain advanced insights into your page performance. This is beneficial for customers who use either Adobe-managed CDN or non-Adobe managed CDN. For customers using a non-Adobe managed CDN, automated traffic reporting can now be enabled for them, thus removing the need to share any traffic report with Adobe.

Please include the domain name for production, stage, and dev environments in your email.  Availability of the early adopter program of this feature is limited.

### Bring your own GitHub {#byo-github}

If you use GitHub to manage your repositories, [you can now validate code directly within your GitHub repositories through Cloud Manager.](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/byo-github.md) This integration eliminates the need to consistently sync code with the Adobe repository and allows you to verify pull requests before merging them into the main branches. This feature is exclusive to public GitHub. Support for self-hosted GitHub is not available.
