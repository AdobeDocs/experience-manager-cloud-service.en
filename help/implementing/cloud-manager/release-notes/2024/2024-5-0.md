## Early adoption program {#early-adoption}

For a chance to test some upcoming features, be a part of Adobe's early adoption program.

### Client-Side Collection via Real Use Monitoring (RUM) {#rum}

You can leverage the [Real Use Monitoring (RUM) Data Service](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/content-requests.md#cliendside-collection) to enable client-side collection for AEM as a Cloud Service.

Real Use Monitoring (RUM) Data Service offers a more precise reflection of user interactions, ensuring a reliable measure of website engagement. It is a great opportunity to gain advanced insights into your page performance. It is beneficial for customers who use either Adobe-managed CDN or non-Adobe managed CDN. For customers using a non-Adobe managed CDN, automated traffic reporting can now be enabled for them, thus removing the need to share any traffic report with Adobe.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to `aemcs-rum-adopter@adobe.com` from the email address associated with your Adobe ID. Include the domain name for production, stage, and dev environments in your email.  Availability of the early adoption program of this feature is limited.

### Bring your own GitHub {#byo-github}

If you use GitHub to manage your repositories, [you can now validate code directly within your GitHub repositories through Cloud Manager](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/private-repositories.md). This integration eliminates the need to sync code consistently with the Adobe repository and lets you verify pull requests before merging them into the main branches. This feature is exclusive to public GitHub. Support for self-hosted GitHub is not available.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to `Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com` from your email address associated with your Adobe ID.

### Experience Audit Dashboard {#experience-audit-dashboard}

[The Cloud Manager Experience Audit dashboard](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/experience-audit-dashboard.md) includes a trended view of your page performance scores along with insights and recommendations to help you improve them. Experience Audit is included as a step in the Cloud Manager production pipeline.
