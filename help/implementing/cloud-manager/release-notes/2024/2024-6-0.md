>See [this page](/help/release-notes/release-notes-cloud/release-notes-current.md) for the current release notes for Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service.

## Release date {#release-date}

The release date for Cloud Manager release 2024.6.0 in AEM as a Cloud Service is June 6, 2024. The next release is planned for July 11, 2024.

## What's New {#what-is-new}

* You can now [use your own GitHub repositories](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/private-repositories.md) as sources for both full-stack and frontend pipelines.
  * You can also use GitHub repositories with [Git submodules](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/git-submodules.md), giving you greater control over auto-generated pipelines for pull request validation. This setup lets you define behaviors for key metrics during the code scanning phase.
  * [You also have the choice](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/github-check-config.md) to preserve the report history on GitHub, name the pipeline, and set pipeline variables to suit your needs.
* [Self-service content restore](/help/operations/restore.md) provides backup restoration for up to seven days and features point-in-time backup restoration for the previous 24 hours, and fixed time restorations for up to seven days.
* [New OakPal rules](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/custom-code-quality-rules.md#oakpal-ui-content-package) were added to the Cloud Manager Code Quality scan. Every new rule added as of June 2024 is a non-breaking change.
  You are urged to address these rules as soon as possible because they can cause pipelines to fail starting with the Cloud Manager August 2024 release.
