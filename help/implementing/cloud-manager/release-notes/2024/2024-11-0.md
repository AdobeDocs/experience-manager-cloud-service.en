### Bring Your Own Git - now with support for GitLab and Bitbucket {#gitlab-bitbucket}

<!-- BOTH CS & AMS -->

The **Bring Your Own Git** feature has been expanded to include support for external repositories such as GitLab and Bitbucket. This new support is in addition to the already existing support for private and enterprise GitHub repositories. When you add these new repos, you can also link them directly to your pipelines. You can host these repositories on public cloud platforms or within your private cloud or infrastructure. This integration also removes the need for constant code synchronization with the Adobe repository and provides the ability to validate pull requests before merging them into a main branch.

See [Add external repositories in Cloud Manager](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/external-repositories.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Currently, the out-of-the-box pull request code quality checks are exclusive to GitHub-hosted repositories, but an update to extend this functionality to other Git vendors is in the works.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to [Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com) from your email address associated with your Adobe ID. Be sure to include which Git platform you want to use and whether you are on a private/public or enterprise repository structure.


## Bug fixes

* A recent update addressed an issue in SonarQube where hardcoded passwords were not detected in certain cases. The fix now includes an expanded pattern check, and aligns with default detection standards in SonarQube. <!-- CMGR-62682 -->
* When trying to update an SSL certificate in Cloud Manager, an unknown error would appear after clicking **[!UICONTROL Update]** in the **[!UICONTROL View & Update SSL Certificate]** dialog box. <!-- CMGR-62848 -->
* In Cloud Manager, SSL certificate updates would fail with the error "The new certificate does not match the existing domains," even when the domains were identical but had differences in letter case (upper- or lower-case). The update now recognizes domains as case-insensitive, aligning with RFC standards. <!-- CMGR-62844 -->
* In Cloud Manager, IP Allowlist bindings remained stuck in a running state because foreign key links to domain configurations were missing. The fix now ensures IP Allowlist bindings link correctly to associated domain configurations. <!-- CMGR-62838 -->
* Cloud Manager validates the OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) status of an SSL certificate. Adobe recommends that you also validate the integrity of your certificate locally using a tool such as `openssl verify -untrusted intermediate.pem certificate.pem` before installing it through Cloud Manager. For more details, see the [SSL certificate requirements documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/manage-ssl-certificates/introduction-to-ssl-certificates#requirements). <!-- CMGR-62341  -->
