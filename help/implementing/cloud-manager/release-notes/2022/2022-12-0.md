## What's new {#what-is-new}

* Notifications for [AEM maintenance updates](/help/overview/what-is-new-and-different.md#aem-updates) are surfaced in the Cloud Manager UI. This change is being rolled out in a phased manner in the weeks after the 2022.12.0 release.
* When an ingestion via the [Content Transfer Tool (CTT)](/help/journey-migration/content-transfer-tool/using-content-transfer-tool/overview-content-transfer-tool.md) is in progress, the environment status in both the developer console and in Cloud Manager display as `Ingestion in Progress`.
* Improvements to the availability and reliability of [Cloud Manager pipelines](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/introduction-ci-cd-pipelines.md) were made.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* A change was made to prevent [front-end pipelines](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/introduction-ci-cd-pipelines.md#front-end) from running while a pipeline execution is in progress in the same environment.
* A change was made to prevent a `PATCH /program//environment//variables` request for environments with the `FAILED` status.
