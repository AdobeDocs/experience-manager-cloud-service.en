## What's new {#what-is-new}

* Improvements to the duration and success rate of pipeline build steps have been implemented and are being rolled out incrementally to all customers through the month of April.
* You can now quickly locate a Git branch by typing the first few characters of its name into the add and edit pipeline wizard's input field. Suggested matches appear for both [production](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/configuring-production-pipelines.md) and [non-production](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/configuring-non-production-pipelines.md) pipelines.
* Shortly after the April release, India became available for selection when defining the cloud region during environment creation.
* The **Pipelines** page now has pagination to improve usability for programs with a large number of pipelines.
  * 50 rows per page are displayed in the table.
* The version of the [AEM Project Archetype](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/overview) used by Cloud Manager has been updated to version 36.
* Oracle JDK is now the default JDK for the development and operation of AEM applications. The Cloud Manager build process switches to using Oracle JDK automatically, even if an alternative option is explicitly selected in the Maven toolchain.
  * To learn more about how to switch to Oracle JDK, see [the Build Environment documentation](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/build-environment-details.md#using-java-support).
  * See [the Java support policy for Adobe Experience Manager FAQ](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/assets/Java_Policy_for_Adobe_Experience_Manager.pdf) to address common questions about this change.
* Pipeline execution now fails faster by detecting older AEM versions during the validation step. Users are presented with a message in the UI to guide them.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* The log created in the UI Test step is now available for download via the UI.
* Web tier config pipelines can now only reuse packages from web tier config executions.
* Greater clarity was added to the messages in the UI about how to update AEM in an outdated environment.
