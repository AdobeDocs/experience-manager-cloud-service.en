## What's new {#what-is-new}

* Accessing AEM Environment log can be done using the Developer role.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* A subset of Git repositories manually created had an incorrect name value that prevented the build artifact reuse feature from being effective. The names of those repositories have been changed and users can see the corrected name in the Cloud Manager API/UI.
* Build artifacts from non-production pipelines were inappropriately reused on production full stack pipelines. When adding or editing a code quality pipeline, the options to handle metric failures is no longer displayed.
* Some unexpected pipeline variable configurations could cause in the build step.
