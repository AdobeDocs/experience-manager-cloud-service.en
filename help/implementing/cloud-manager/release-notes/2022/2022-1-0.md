## Release date {#release-date}

The release date for Cloud Manager in AEM as a Cloud Service 2022.01.0 is January 20, 2022. The next release is planned for February 10, 2022.

## What's new {#what-is-new}

* Cloud Manager will [avoid rebuilding the code base when it detects that the same git commit is used](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/setting-up-project.md#build-artifact-reuse) in multiple full-stack pipeline executions.
* Accessing the AEM environment log now requires the **Deployment Manager** product profile. Users without this profile see a disabled button in the user interface.
* The UI will not allow front-end pipeline configuration for a program where Sites is not enabled as a solution. 
* On generating a git password, the expiration date is displayed.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* Null pointer exceptions encountered by some front-end pipeline deployments have been corrected.
* Environment variables can now be added, updated, and deleted when an environment is running an outdated version of AEM.
* The build image step will no longer be marked as ERROR for pipelines that used the scheduled step in certain rare cases.
* For programs with only one repository, the pipeline execution screen will now display the repository name.
