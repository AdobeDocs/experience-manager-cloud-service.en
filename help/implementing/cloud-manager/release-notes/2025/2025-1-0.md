## Release dates {#release-date}

The release date for Cloud Manager 2025.1.0 in AEM as a Cloud Service is Wednesday, January 22, 2025. 

The next planned release is Thursday, February 13, 2025.
 

## What's new {#what-is-new}

* **Code quality rules - SonarQube Server Upgrade:** Cloud Manager Code Quality step will start using SonarQube Server 9.9 with Cloud Manager 2025.2.0 release, scheduled for Thursday, February 13, 2025. 

    To prepare, updated SonarQube rules are now available at [Code Quality Rules](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/code-quality-testing.md#understanding-code-quality-rules).

    You can "early check" the new rules by setting the following pipeline text variable: 

    `CM_BUILD_IMAGE_OVERRIDE` = `self-service-build:sonar-99-upgrade-java17or21`

    Additionally, set the following variable to ensure the code quality step runs for the same commit (normally skipped for the same `commitId`): 

    `CM_DISABLE_BUILD_REUSE` = `true`

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends creating a new CI/CD Code Quality pipeline, configured to the same branch as your main production pipeline. Set the appropriate variables *before* the February 13, 2025 release to validate that the new enforced rules do not introduce blockers.

* **Java 17 and Java 21 build support:** Customers can now build with Java 17 or Java 21, gaining access to performance enhancements and new language features. For configuration steps, including updating your Maven project and library versions, see [Build environment](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/build-environment-details.md). When the build version is set to Java 17 or Java 21, the runtime deployed is Java 21.

    * **Feature enablement**
        * This feature will be enabled for all customers on Thursday, February 13, 2025, coinciding with the default rollout of the new SonarQube version.
        * Customers can enable it *immediately* by setting the two variable configurations described above for upgrading the SonarQube 9.9 version.

    * **Java 21 runtime deployment**
        * The Java 21 runtime is deployed when building with Java 17 or Java 21.
        * Gradual rollout to all Cloud Manager environments begins in February for sandboxes and development environments and extends to production environments in April.
        * Customers building with Java 11 who wish to adopt the Java 21 runtime *earlier* can contact Adobe at [aemcs-java-adopter@adobe.com](mailto:aemcs-java-adopter@adobe.com).

* **"CDN Configurations" renamed to "Domain Mappings" :** As part of user interface improvements in AEM Cloud Manager, the label "CDN Configurations" is now renamed to "Domain Mappings." This change improves terminology alignment with functionality. <!-- CMGR-64738 -->

* **Provision an Edge Delivery Site with one click:** Cloud Manager now enables users with the appropriate permissions and licenses to create a sample Edge Delivery Services site with just a single click. This streamlined process offers the following automated functionalities:

  * **GitHub Integration** - Automatically creates a GitHub repository within an existing organization, pre-configured with a boilerplate template for Edge Delivery Services.
  * **AEM Code Sync App Installation** - Installs the AEM Code Sync application on the repository, ensuring seamless synchronization and deployment.
  * **Content Collaboration Setup** - Links a designated Google Drive folder for content storage, providing a collaborative environment for content management.
  * **Content Publishing** - Users can now publish content for provisioned sites directly from the Cloud Manager user interface, simplifying workflows and improving efficiency.
  * **Enhanced Collaboration** - The platform allows users to add multiple collaborators to the Google Drive content storage folder, facilitating teamwork and content contributions.

  These enhancements aim to improve automation, simplify setup processes, and enhance collaboration for Edge Delivery Services users. <!-- CMGR-59362 -->

* **Enhanced support for Edge Delivery Services sites:** Cloud Manager now supports onboarding for the latest Edge Delivery Services sites. This update includes a comprehensive refactoring of the CDN and delivery stack, resulting in improved robustness and maintainability.

* **Advanced filtering options for pipelines:** Cloud Manager now features advanced filtering options on the Pipelines page, letting you quickly access relevant data and enhance deployment efficiency. Several of the key features include the following:

    * **Multi-Criteria Filtering:** Refine search results with filters such as pipeline name, environment, and deploy code.
    * **Streamlined Pipeline Search:** Easily locate specific pipelines for faster navigation and improved workflow management.

    Altogether, these enhancements make managing and deploying pipelines more efficient and user-friendly.

* **Self-Service CDN Configuration for Edge Delivery Service:** New adopters of Edge Delivery Service can now configure their CDN independently through Cloud Manager. This update extends support from `.hlx.page/live` to the new `.aem.page/live`, providing greater flexibility and streamlined setup for users.

## Early adoption program {#early-adoption}

* **Early Adopter program update - PR validation support for Bitbucket and GitLab:** Cloud Manager now supports Pull Request (PR) validation for both Cloud and self-hosted versions of Bitbucket and GitLab. This feature lets customers test their code changes against Adobe's code quality thresholds before merging a PR. By ensuring higher code quality prior to merging, this enhancement significantly improves the success rate of code changes in production pipelines, reducing time to market and streamlining development workflows.

    For more information about "Bring Your Own Git" - now with support for GitLab and Bitbucket - and to sign up as an Early Adopter, see [Cloud Manager October 2024 Release Notes](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/release-notes/2024/2024-10-0.md##gitlab-bitbucket).

* **Advanced Test Environment:** A purpose-built solution designed to bridge the gap between development and production. Tailored for enterprise needs, this environment replicates production-level specifications to support accurate user acceptance testing (UAT) and thorough performance evaluations.
