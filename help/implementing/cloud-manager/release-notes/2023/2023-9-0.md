Experience Audit is included as a step in the Cloud Manager production pipeline.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* When a program is deleted, any associated running pipeline is now also deleted.
* If a pipeline is in progress, the **Send** button of the **Go-live complete** dialog is now disabled and informs the user that the go-live date can't be set because of the running pipeline.
* An occasional error has been fixed where all steps of a pipeline execution were marked as completed, but the status of the pipeline was still running, giving the appearance of a stuck state.
