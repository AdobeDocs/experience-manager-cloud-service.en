## Early Adoption Program {#early-adoption}

For a chance to test some upcoming features, be a part of Adobe's early adoption program.

### Client-Side Collection via Real User Monitoring (RUM) {#rum}

You can leverage the [Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/content-requests.md#cliendside-collection) to enable client-side collection for AEM as a Cloud Service.

Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service offers a more precise reflection of user interactions, ensuring a reliable measure of website engagement. It is a great opportunity to gain advanced insights into your page performance. This is beneficial for customers who use either Adobe-managed CDN or non-Adobe managed CDN. For customers using a non-Adobe managed CDN, automated traffic reporting can now be enabled for them, thus removing the need to share any traffic report with Adobe.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, please send an email to `aemcs-rum-adopter@adobe.com` from the email address associated with your Adobe ID. Please include the domain name for production, stage, and dev environments in your email.  Availability of the early adopter program of this feature is limited.

### Bring your own GitHub {#byo-github}

If you use GitHub to manage your repositories, [you can now validate code directly within your GitHub repositories through Cloud Manager.](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/byo-github.md) This integration eliminates the need to consistently sync code with the Adobe repository and allows you to verify pull requests before merging them into the main branches.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to `Grp-CloudManager_BYOG@adobe.com` from your email address associated with your Adobe ID.

### Self-Service Content Restore {#content-restore}

* Point-in-time backup restoration for the previous 24 hours
* Fixed time restorations for up to seven days

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to `aemcs-restorefrombackup-adopter@adobe.com` from your email associated with your Adobe ID.

### Experience Audit Dashboard {#experience-audit-dashboard}

[The Cloud Manager Experience Audit dashboard](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/experience-audit-dashboard.md) includes a trended view of your page performance scores along with insights and recommendations to help you improve them. Experience Audit is included as a step in the Cloud Manager production pipeline.

The dashboard uses Google Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of your web apps. You can run it against any web page, public, or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more.

Interested in test-driving the new dashboard? To get started, send an email to `aem-lighthouse-pilot@adobe.com` from your email associated with your Adobe ID.
