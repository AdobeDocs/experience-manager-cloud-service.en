### Experience Audit Dashboard {#experience-audit-dashboard}

[The Cloud Manager Experience Audit dashboard](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/experience-audit-dashboard.md) includes a trended view of your page performance scores along with insights and recommendations to help you improve them. Experience Audit is included as a step in the Cloud Manager production pipeline.

The dashboard leverages Google Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of your web apps. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more.

## Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes}

* The **Environments** menu now closes after triggering the **[Copy Content](/help/implementing/developing/tools/content-copy.md)** modal.
* [A pipeline re-execution](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/deploy-code.md#reexecute-deployment) is no longer allowed if the previous execution does not have a `commitId` set on the build phase state.
* A more understandable message is now displayed for rare errors when a user clicks on a pipeline in the **Activity** or **Pipeline** screens.
* The `contentSetName` value is no longer missing in logs and is now provided in the inputs when starting a [content copy](/help/implementing/developing/tools/content-copy.md) operation.
* It is no longer possible under certain rare circumstances to start two executions from the same pipeline leading to a "stuck" state.
* When a certificate expires, domain names and IP allow-lists associated with the certificate will no longer be removed from the CDN.
  * In such cases, the site will continue to be reachable.
  * [The Cloud Manager UI](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-ssl-certifications/introduction.md) will provide more visible advance warnings that the SSL certificate is about to expire.
* A problem with AEM losing access to a publish endpoint was fixed in situations when Sites is added as a solution to an Assets-only program.
