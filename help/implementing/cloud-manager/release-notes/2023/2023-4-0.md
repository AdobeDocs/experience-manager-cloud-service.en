## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* When a [certificate](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-ssl-certifications/introduction-to-ssl-certificates.md) expires, [domain names](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/custom-domain-names/introduction.md) and [IP Allowlists](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/ip-allow-lists/introduction.md) associated with the certificate can no longer be removed from the CDN.

* A rare situation was fixed where customers were unable to create an environment or delete an environment.
