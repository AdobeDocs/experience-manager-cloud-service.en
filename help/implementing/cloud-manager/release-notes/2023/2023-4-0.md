## Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes}

* When a [certificate](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-ssl-certifications/introduction.md) expires, [domain names](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/custom-domain-names/introduction.md) and [IP allow lists](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/ip-allow-lists/introduction.md) associated with the certificate will no longer be removed from the CDN.  In such cases, the site will continue to be reachable.
* The Cloud Manager UI will provide more visible advance warnings that the [SSL certificate](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-ssl-certifications/introduction.md) is about to expire.
* A rare situation was fixed where customers were unable to create a new environment or delete an environment.
