## Release date {#release-date}

The release date for Cloud Manager release 2023.5.0 in AEM as a Cloud Service is 11 May 2023. The next release is planned for 8 June 2023.

## What's new {#what-is-new}

* Product, functional, and UI testing support has been extended to [non-production pipeline testing](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/configuring-non-production-pipelines.md).
* In addition to enabling testing upstream, [UI testing support has been extended to Cypress testing](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/ui-testing.md).
* [Self-service content copy](/help/implementing/developing/tools/content-copy.md) is now available from a higher to a lower environment via the Cloud Manager UI. 
* The pipeline execution validation step has been enhanced to validate the state of the replication queues early in the execution process. This ensures the deployment steps are not affected by blocked queues that should be addressed by AEM administrator users directly in the authoring environment.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* Environment creation no longer fails when multi-byte characters are used in the environment's name.
