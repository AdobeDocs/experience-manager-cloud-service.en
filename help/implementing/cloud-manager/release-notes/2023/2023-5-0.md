## Release date {#release-date}

The release date for Cloud Manager release 2023.5.0 in AEM as a Cloud Service is May 11, 2023. The next release is planned for June 8, 2023.

## What's new {#what-is-new}

* Product, functional, and UI testing support has been extended to [non-production pipeline testing](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/configuring-non-production-pipelines.md).
* In addition to enabling testing upstream, [UI testing support has been extended to Cypress testing](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/ui-testing.md).
* [Self-service content copy](/help/implementing/developing/tools/content-copy.md) is now available from a higher to a lower environment via the Cloud Manager UI. 
* The pipeline execution validation step now includes an early check of the replication queues' state, ensuring that blocked queues are identified before deployment begins. AEM administrator users should address any issues directly in the authoring environment to prevent disruptions in deployment.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

* Environment creation no longer fails when multi-byte characters are used in the environment's name.
