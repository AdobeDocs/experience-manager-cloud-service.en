## What's New {#what-is-new}

* Customers can purchase additional secondary publish regions in addition to the primary region, resulting in benefits related to reduced latency and higher availability. Note: Certain restrictions may apply. 
* When creating a [program or environment,](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/program-types.md) the name is now restricted to accept only alphanumeric characters and a limited set of special characters.
* When resuming a [production pipeline,](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/configuring-production-pipelines.md) a confirmation dialog is now displayed at the approve step.
* For the **[Customer Functional Tests](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/functional-testing.md#custom-functional-testing)** and **[Custom UI Testing](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/ui-testing.md)** pipeline steps, a new `INCOMPLETE` status is now possible, which indicates that such tests were not present and hence not performed.
  * In such cases, the pipeline does not fail and proceeds to the next step.

## Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes}

* The [web tier config pipeline](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/introduction-ci-cd-pipelines.md#web-tier-config-pipelines) are no longer incorrectly enabled for Assets-only programs.
* More robust validation was added to prevent certain types of failures during environment provisioning.
