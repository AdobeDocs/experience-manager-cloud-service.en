### What's New {#what-is-new}

* Assets customers will now be able to choose when and where to deploy their Brand Portal instance in a self-service way via Cloud Manager UI. For a regular (non sandbox) program with Assets solution, Brand Portal can now be provisioned on the Production environment. The provisioning can be done only once on Production environment.

* The AEM Project Archetype used in Project and Sandbox Creation has been updated to version 25. 

* The list of deprecated APIs identified during code scanning has been refined to include additional classes and methods deprecated in the latest Cloud Service SDK releases.

* SonarQube profile for Cloud Manager updated to remove Sonar rule squid:S2142. This will no longer conflict with Thread Interruption checks.

* Cloud Manager UI will inform the user who may not temporarily not be able to add/update domain name because the associated environment either has a running pipeline attached to it or currently in the waiting for the approval step.

* Properties set in customer `pom.xml` files prefixed with sonar will now be dynamically removed in order to avoid build and quality scanning failures.

* Cloud Manager UI will inform the user who may not temporarily not be able to select an SSL certificate if it is in use by a Domain name that's currently being deployed.

* Additional Code Quality Rules have been added to cover Cloud Service Compatibility issues.

### Bug Fixes  {#bug-fixes}

* Matching SSL certificate against a domain name is no longer case sensitive.

* Cloud Manager UI will now inform a user if the certificate private keys does not meet the 2048 bit limit with an appropriate error message.

* Cloud Manager UI will inform the user who may not temporarily not be able to select an SSL certificate if it is in use by a Domain name that is currently being deployed.

* In some cases, an internal issue may cause environment deletion to be stuck. 

* Some pipeline failures were incorrectly reported as pipeline errors.
