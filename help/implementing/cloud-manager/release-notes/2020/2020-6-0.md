The delete option is now available from both the Environment card on the **Programs Overview** page and the **Environments** page. Selecting the delete option on either Production or Stage also deletes the other in the set.

* Coach marks on the landing page to inform and instruct the user about basic navigation.

* Coach marks on the **Program Overview** page to inform and instruct the user about basic navigation inside Cloud Manager to get them started.

* A **LEARN** page is now available in Cloud Manager, accessible via the top navigation. This page includes resources to help users learn about the most frequently used work-flows as relevant to their roles assigned in Cloud Manager.

* A **Sandbox** badge now identifies Sandbox Programs, appearing on the program card on the landing page. It is also displayed next to the program name in the **Program Overview** page.

* A user in the SysAdmin role now has one-click access to the location in the Admin Console from where user roles or permissions to Cloud Manager can be managed. A **Manage Access** button is now available on the landing page next to the **Add Program** button.
  
* A user in the SysAdmin role now has one-click access to author instance directly from Cloud Manager. 

* The Build log now includes the list of discovered artifacts, including skipped content packages.

* The Build step now validates that generated content packages include all mandatory properties â€“ name, group and version.

* The Build step now validates that the build produced at least one content package.

### Bug fixes {#bug-fixes-cm}

* In certain situations, the icons in the **Create Program** dialog were misaligned.

* The AEM release identifier was not consistently displayed on the **Programs Overview** page.

* When configuring the production pipeline, the **Scheduled Deployment** option was not visible for some customers.

### Known issues {#known-issues-cm}

* Environments within a Sandbox Program are hibernated when no activity is detected for a certain duration. This status is not observed in Cloud Manager. However, the status can be observed through the Developer Console. This ability is being addressed in an upcoming release.

* The link to the Developer Console directly from Cloud Manager does not display the option to de-hibernate/hibernate a Sandbox Program's environment. To address this issue, at the Developer Console, add the pattern `#release-cm-p1234-e5678` to the end of the url, where *1234* is the Program ID and *5678* is the Environment ID. This ability is being addressed in an upcoming release.
