# Add a CDN configuration {#add-cdn}

To link a domain with an SSL certificate on the Adobe-managed CDN within your program, you must add a CDN (Content Delivery Network) configuration.

For Adobe managed CDNs, when using a DV SSL certificate, only sites with ACME validation are permitted. 

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Have you [added a custom domain name](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/custom-domain-names/add-custom-domain-name.md) and [added an SSL certificate](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-ssl-certifications/add-ssl-certificate.md), respectively? If not, you must complete these two tasks before you can add a CDN configuration.

**To add a CDN configuration:**

1. Log into Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization.

1. Depending on your use case, do one of the following:
