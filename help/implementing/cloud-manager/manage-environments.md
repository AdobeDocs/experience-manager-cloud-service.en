# Managing Environments {#manage-environments} 

The following section describes the types of environment a  user can create and how the user can create an environment.

## Environment Types {#environment-types}

A user with the requisite permissions can create the following environment types (within the bounds of what is available to the specific tenant). 

* **Production and Stage Environment**: 
The Production and Stage is available as a duo and is used for testing and production purposes.  

* **Development**: A Development environment can be created for development and testing purposes and will be associated with non-production pipelines only.

  >[!NOTE]
  >A Development environment that is auto-created in a Sandbox program will be configured to include Sites and Assets solutions.
   
  The following table summarizes Environment types and their attributes:

   |Name|Author Tier|Publish Tier|User Can create| User can delete|Pipeline which can be associated with environment|
   |--- |--- |--- |--- |---|---|
   |Production |Yes |Yes if Sites included |Yes |No|Production pipeline|
   |Stage |Yes |Yes if Sites included |Yes |No|Production pipeline|
   |Development |Yes |Yes if Sites included |Yes |Yes|Non-production pipeline|

   >[!NOTE]
   >The Production and Stage is available as a duo and is used for testing and production purposes.  User will not be able to create only Stage or only Production environment.

## Adding Environment {#adding-environments}

### Accessing Preview Service {#access-preview-service}

Preview Service feature delivers an additional Preview (publish) Service to each AEM as a Cloud Service environment via Cloud Manager. 

Preview a website's final experience before it reaches the publish environment and is available publicly. A few pointers before you you can see and use Preview Service:

1. **AEM Version**: Your environment must be on AEM version `2021.5.5343.20210542T070738Z` or higher. Make sure an update pipeline has successfully run on your environment to accomplish this. 

1. **Default IP Allow List lock**: Upon first creation, you must actively unapply the default IP Allow List from the Preview Service in your environment in order to enable access.

   A user with requisite permissions must do one of the following in order to *unlock* access to preview service and provide the desired access:

   * Create an appropriate IP Allow list and apply it to the preview service. Follow this immediately by unapplying `Preview Default [Env ID] IP Allow List` from the Preview Service.

      *OR*,

   * Use the update IP Allow List workflow to remove the default IP and add IP(s) as appropriate. Refer to [Viewing and Updating an IP Allow List](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/ip-allow-lists/view-update-ip-allow-list.md) to learn more. 

      >[!NOTE]
      >The above steps must be done in advance of sharing the preview service URL with any of your teams in order to ensure the appropriate members of your team are able to access the preview URL.

      Once access to preview service is unlocked, the lock icon will no longer be displayed, as shown below.

      ![](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/assets/preview-service1.png)

1. **Publish Content to Preview**: You can publish content to the Preview Service by using the Manage Publication UI inside AEM. Refer to [Previewing Content](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/fundamentals/previewing-content.html?lang=en) for more details.

## Updating Environment {#updating-dev-environment}

Updates of Stage and Production environments are automatically managed by Adobe. 

Updates to Development environments are managed by users of the program. When an environment is not running the latest publicly available AEM release, the status on Environments Card on the Home Screen will show **UPDATE AVAILABLE**.

![](assets/environ-update.png)


The **Update** option is available from the **Environments** Card. 
This option is also available, if you click on **Details** from the **Environments** card. The **Environments** page opens and once you select the Development environment, click on **...** and select **Update**, as shown in the figure below:

![](assets/environ-update2.png)

Selecting this option will allow a Deployment Manager to update the pipeline associated with this environment to the latest release and then execute the pipeline. 

If the pipeline has already been updated, the user is prompted to execute the pipeline.

## Deleting Environment {#deleting-environment}

User with the requisite permissions will be able to delete a Development environment.
