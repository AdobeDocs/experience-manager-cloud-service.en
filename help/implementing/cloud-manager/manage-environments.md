# Managing Environments {#manage-environments} 

The following section describes the types of environment a  user can create and how the user can create an environment.

## Environment Types {#environment-types}

A user with the requisite permissions can create the following environment types (within the bounds of what is available to the specific tenant). 

* **Production and Stage Environment**: 
The Production and Stage is available as a duo and is used for testing and production purposes.  

* **Development**: A Development environment can be created for development and testing purposes and will be associated with non-production pipelines only.

  >[!NOTE]
  >A Development environment that is auto-created in a Sandbox program will be configured to include Sites and Assets solutions.
   
  The following table summarizes Environment types and their attributes:

   |Name|Author Tier|Publish Tier|User Can create| User can delete|Pipeline which can be associated with environment|
   |--- |--- |--- |--- |---|---|
   |Production |Yes |Yes if Sites included |Yes |No|Production pipeline|
   |Stage |Yes |Yes if Sites included |Yes |No|Production pipeline|
   |Development |Yes |Yes if Sites included |Yes |Yes|Non-production pipeline|

   >[!NOTE]
