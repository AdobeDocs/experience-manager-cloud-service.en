# Notifications {#notifications} 

[!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] allows the user to receive notifications when the production pipeline starts and completes (successfully or unsuccessfully), during a production deployment.

These notifications are sent through the Adobe [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud] notification system to users with the roles **Business Owner**, **Program Manager**, and **Deployment Manager**.

The notifications appear at the right end of the menu bar in the [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] UI and throughout Adobe [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud].
