# Cloud Manager FAQs {#cloud-manager-faqs}

This document provides answers to the most frequently-asked questions about Cloud Manager in AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Is it possible to use Java 11 with Cloud Manager builds? {#java-11-cloud-manager}

Yes. You will need to add the `maven-toolchains-plugin` with proper settings for Java 11.

The process is documented [here](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/using-the-wizard.md#getting-started).

For example, see the [wknd project sample project code](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd/commit/6cb5238cb6b932735dcf91b21b0d835ae3a7fe75).

## My build fails with an error about maven-scr-plugin after switching from Java 8 to Java 11. What can I do? {#build-fails-maven-scr-plugin}

Your AEM Cloud Manager build may fail when attempting to switch the build from Java 8 to 11. If you encounter the following error, then you need to remove `maven-scr-plugin` and convert all OSGi annotations to OSGi R6 annotations.

```text
[main] [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.felix:maven-scr-plugin:1.26.4:scr (generate-scr-scrdescriptor) on project helloworld.core: /build_root/build/testsite/src/main/java/com/adobe/HelloWorldServiceImpl.java : Unable to load compiled class: com.adobe.HelloWorldServiceImpl: com/adobe/HelloWorldServiceImpl has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0 -> [Help 1]
```

For instructions on how to remove this plugin, see [here.](https://cqdump.wordpress.com/2019/01/03/from-scr-annotations-to-osgi-annotations/)

## My build fails with an error about RequireJavaVersion after switching from Java 8 to Java 11. What can I do? {#build-fails-requirejavaversion}

For Cloud Manager builds, the `maven-enforcer-plugin` can fail with this error.

```text
"[main] [WARNING] Rule 1: org.apache.maven.plugins.enforcer.RequireJavaVersion".
```

This is a known issue due to Cloud Manager using a different version of Java to run the maven command versus compiling code. Simply omit `requireJavaVersion` from your `maven-enforcer-plugin` configurations.

## The code quality check failed and our deployment is stuck. Is there a way to bypass this check? {#deployment-stuck}

Yes. All code quality check failures except for the security rating are non-critical metrics, so they can be bypassed as part of a deployment pipeline by expanding the items in the results UI.

A user with [Deployment Manager, Project Manager, or Business Owner](/help/onboarding/aem-cs-team-product-profiles.md#cloud-manager-product-profiles) role can override the issues, in which case the pipeline proceeds or they can accept the issues, in which case the pipeline stops with a failure.

See the documents [Code Quality Testing](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/code-quality-testing.md#three-tiered-gate) and [Configuring Non-Production Pipelines](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configuring-pipelines/configuring-non-production-pipelines.md#non-production-pipelines) for more details.

## Can I use SNAPSHOT for the version of the Maven project? {#use-snapshot}

Yes. For developer deployments, the git branch `pom.xml` files must contain `-SNAPSHOT` at the end of the `<version>` value.

This allows subsequent deployment to still be installed when the version did not change. In developer deployments, no automatic version is added or generated for the maven build.

You can also set the version to `-SNAPSHOT` for stage and production builds or deployments. Cloud Manager automatically sets a proper version number and creates a tag for you in git. This tag can be referred to later, if required.

Further details about version handling are [documented here.](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/project-version-handling.md)

## How does package and bundle versioning work for stage and production deployments? {#snapshot-version}

In stage and production deployments, an automatic version is generated as [documented here.](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/managing-code/project-version-handling.md)

For custom versioning in stage and production deployments, set a proper three-part maven version like `1.0.0`. Increase the version each time you deploy to production.

Cloud Manager automatically adds its version to stage and production builds and creates a git branch. No special configuration is required. If you do not set a maven version as described previously, the deployment will still succeed and a version will automatically be set.

## My maven build fails for Cloud Manager deployments but it builds locally without errors. What is wrong? {#maven-build-fail}

See [this git resource](https://github.com/cqsupport/cloud-manager/blob/main/cm-build-step-fails.md) for more details.

## What do I do if a Cloud Manager deployment fails at the deploy step in AEM as a Cloud Service? {#cloud-manager-deployment-cloud-service}

The most common reason for a deployment to fail is due to insufficient permissions for the `sling-distribution-importer` user. In this situation, the deploy step fails during a Cloud Manager deployment and errors such as the following are generated.

```text
[Queue Processor for Subscriber agent forwardPublisherSubscriber] org.apache.jackrabbit.vault.fs.io.Importer Error while committing changes. Retrying import from checkpoint at /. Retries 4/10
[Queue Processor for Subscriber agent forwardPublisherSubscriber] org.apache.sling.distribution.journal.impl.subscriber DistributionSubscriber Error processing queue item

Caused by: org.apache.sling.api.resource.PersistenceException: Unable to commit changes to session.
Caused by: javax.jcr.AccessDeniedException: OakAccess0000: Access denied [EventAdminAsyncThread #7] org.apache.sling.distribution.journal.impl.publisher.DistributionPublisher [null] Error processing distribution package` `dstrpck-1583514457813-c81e7751-2da6-4d00-9814-434187f08d32. Retry attempts 344/infinite. Message: Error trying to extract package at path /etc/packages/com.myapp/myapp-base.ui.content-5.1.0-SNAPSHOT.
```

The `sling-distribution-importer` user needs additional permissions for the content paths defined in the `ui.content package`.  This usually means you need to add permissions for both `/conf` and `/var`.

The solution is to add a [RepositoryInitializer OSGi configuration](/help/implementing/deploying/overview.md#repoint) script to your apps deployment package to add ACLs for the `sling-distribution-importer` user.

In the previous example error, the package `myapp-base.ui.content-*.zip` includes content under `/conf` and `/var/workflow`. In order for the deployment to succeed, permissions for the `sling-distribution-importer` under those paths is needed.

Here's an example of an [`org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit.RepositoryInitializer-DistributionService.config`](https://github.com/cqsupport/cloud-manager/blob/main/org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit.RepositoryInitializer-distribution.config) OSGi configuration that adds additional permissions for the `sling-distribution-importer` user.  The configuration adds permissions under `/var`.  Such a configuration must be added to the application package under `/apps/myapp/config` (where myapp is the folder where your application code is stored).

## My Cloud Manager deployment fails at the deploy step in AEM as a Cloud Service and I already added a RepositoryInitializer OSGi configuration. What else can I do? {#build-failures}

If [adding a RepositoryInitializer OSGi configuration](#cloud-manager-deployment-cloud-service) did not solve the error, it may be due to one of these additional issues.

* The deployment might be failing due to a bad OSGi configuration that breaks an out-of-the box service. 
  * Check the logs during deployment to see if there are any obvious errors.

* The deployment might fail due to bad dispatcher or Apache configurations.
  * Make sure to test your Apache and dispatcher configurations locally using the Docker image included in the SDK.
  * See [Dispatcher in the Cloud](/help/implementing/dispatcher/disp-overview.md#content-delivery) on how to set up the dispatcher Docker container for easy local testing.

* The deployment might fail due to some other failure during replication of the content packages (Sling distribution) from author to publish instances. 
  * Follow these steps to simulate the issue on a local setup.
    1. Install an author and publish instance locally using the latest AEM SDK jars.
    1. Log into the author instance.
    1. Go to **Tools** -&gt; **Deployment** -&gt; **Distribution**.
    1. Distribute the content packages that are part of the code base and see if the queue gets blocked with an error.

## I am unable to set a variable using an aio command. What can I do? {#set-variable} 

You may receive a `403` error such as the following when attempting to list or set pipeline variables via `aio` commands.

```shell
$ aio cloudmanager:list-pipeline-variables 222

Cannot get variables: https://cloudmanager.adobe.io/api/program/111/pipeline/222/variables (403 Forbidden)

$ aio cloudmanager:set-pipeline-variables 222 --variable TEST 1

Cannot get variables: https://cloudmanager.adobe.io/api/program/111/pipeline/222/variables (403 Forbidden)

$ aio cloudmanager:set-environment-variables 1755 --variable TEST 1

setting variables... !

Cannot set variables: https://cloudmanager.adobe.io/api/program/111/environment/222/variables (403 Forbidden)
```

In this case, the user executing these commands needs to be added to the **Deployment Manager** role in the Admin Console.

See [API Permissions](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/cloud-manager/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/cloudmanager-api-docs/master/permissions.md) for more details.
