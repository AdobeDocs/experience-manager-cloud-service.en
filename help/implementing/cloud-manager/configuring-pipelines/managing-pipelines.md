# Manage pipelines {#managing-pipelines}

Learn how to manage your existing pipelines including editing, running, and deleting them.

## Pipeline card {#pipeline-card}

The **Pipelines** card on the **Program Overview** page in Cloud Manager gives you an overview of all of your pipelines and their current status.

![Pipelines card in Cloud Manager](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/assets/configure-pipeline/pipelines-card.png)

By clicking ![Ellipsis - More icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_More_18_N.svg) next to each pipeline, you can take the following actions:

* [Run a pipeline](#running-pipelines)
* [Cancel a pipeline](#cancel)
* [Edit a pipeline](#editing-pipelines)
* [Delete a pipeline](#deleting-pipelines)
* [View last run details of a pipeline](#view-details)

At the bottom of the list of pipelines, you have the following general options:

* **Add** - To [add a new production pipeline](configuring-production-pipelines.md) or [add a new non-production pipeline](configuring-non-production-pipelines.md)
* **Show All** - Takes the user to the Pipelines screen to view all pipelines in a more detailed table.
* **Access Repo Info** - Displays the information necessary to access the Cloud Manager git repository
* **Learn More** - Navigates to CI/CD pipeline documentation resources.

## Pipelines page {#pipelines}

The **Pipelines** page shows a complete list of all pipelines for the selected program. This information is useful because it presents more comprehensive information than what is available in the [Pipeline card](#pipeline-card).

1. Log into Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization.

1. On the **[My Programs](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/navigation.md#my-programs)** console, select the program.

1. From the **Program Overview** page, click ![Pipeline tab - Workflow icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Workflow_18_N.svg) **Pipelines** tab.

1. On the **Pipelines** page, you can see a list of all pipelines for the program and start and stop pipeline execution as you would in the **Pipelines Card**.

If a pipeline is executing, click ![Info - medium icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/ui_18/InfoMedium.svg) in the **Status** column to display a pop-up with details about the execution. Within the pop-up, click **View details** to see the [details of the pipeline execution](#view-details).

![Pipeline execution details](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/assets/configure-pipeline/pipeline-status.png)


You can also click ![Ellipsis - More icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_More_18_N.svg) next to the pipeline to take additional actions appropriate to the pipeline state such as [editing](#editing-pipelines) it or [canceling execution](#cancel).

![Pipeline actions](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/assets/configure-pipeline/pipeline-actions.png)

## Activity page {#activity}

The **Activity** page shows a complete list of all pipelines executions for the selected program as well as other important program events.

1. Log into Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization and program.

1. From the **Program Overview** page, in the side menu, click ![Bell icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Bell_18_N.svg) **Activity**.

If a pipeline is executing, you can click ![Info - medium icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/ui_18/InfoMedium.svg) in the **Status** column to display a pop-up showing you information about the execution.

![Pipeline execution details](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/assets/configure-pipeline/pipeline-activity.png)

Click the row representing the pipeline execution to view the [details of the pipeline execution](#view-details).

You can also click ![Ellipsis - More icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_More_18_N.svg) to take additional action on the pipeline execution, such as view its details or download the log, which takes you to the [pipeline details page](#view-details).

   All the steps in a pipeline execution are displayed with the ones not yet started grayed out. Finished steps display their duration.

   After a pipeline step is complete, a summary is presented.

   ![Code quality issues](assets/managing-pipelines-code-quality-issues.png)

   The CSV file includes a **Project File Location** column, showing the path to the problematic code relative to the project. In contrast, the **File Location** column reflects the Maven-generated path.
