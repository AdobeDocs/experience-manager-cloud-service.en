# SLA Reporting {#sla-reporting} 

Follow the sections below to learn about SLA Reporting in AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Customers are able to see the performance of their production AEM environment relative to their contracted Service Level Agreement (SLA). This is available through a menu on the Reports tab, accessible from the main header. 

Follow the example below, that is a graph showing the monthly SLA attainment for 2021.

>[!NOTE]
>These reports will be made available to customers on a progressive basis. If you do not see the Reports option in the main navigation, contact your Adobe representative to understand when your reports will be made available.

The Event Analysis section under this graph shows the set of incidents which occurred for the program during the currently selected year. 

Each of the incidents has a time range, a cause, and a set of comments, as shown in the figure below.
