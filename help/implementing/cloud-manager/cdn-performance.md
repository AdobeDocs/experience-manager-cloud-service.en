# CDN Performance dashboard {#cdn-performance}

Understand how Cloud Manager evaluates content delivery network (CDN) performance and what you can learn from the dashboard.

## Overview {#overview}

Every Cloud Manager program has a CDN performance dashboard. This dashboard presents an overall score for CDN performance along with trends, alerts, and suggestions for improvement as necessary.

## Cache hit definition {#cache-hit}

The cache hit ratio is a measurement of how many content requests a cache can fill successfully, compared to how many requests it receives. The higher a cache-hit ratio, the better performing a CDN is.

>[!TIP]
>
>Adobe recommends that users aim for a cache hit ratio of 99%. 

```text
Cache Hit Ratio = Cache Hits / (Hits + Misses + Passes + Other)
```

* **Hit** - Data is requested from the cache, and it is found.
* **Miss** - Data is requested from the cache, and it is not found.
* **Pass** - Data is requested from the cache, and it is set not to cache this data in any case.
* **Other** - All data requests from the cache that do not match any other case.

Cache metrics are updated every 24 hours.
