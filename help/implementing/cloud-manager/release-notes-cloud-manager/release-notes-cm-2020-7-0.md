* The **Cancel** and **Save** options on the Non-Production Pipeline edit page were not always visible.

* Certain failures in the code quality process could result in the log file not being generated correctly.

* When creating a new program, the suggested name would sometimes return a duplicate of an existing program name.

* Some large pipeline step logs could not be consistently downloaded through the user interface.

* The validation of environment names had an off-by-one error.

* The Environments page would sometimes show publish and dispatcher segments when none was present.

### Known Issues {#known-issues}
