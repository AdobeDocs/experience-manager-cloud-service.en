### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-cm}

* In certain situations, the icons in the **Create Program** dialog were misaligned.

* The AEM release identifier was not consistently displayed on the **Programs Overview** page.

* When configuring the production pipeline, the **Scheduled Deployment** option was not visible for some customers.

### Known Issues {#known-issues-cm}

* Environments within a Sandbox program will be hibernated when no activity is detected for a certain duration. This status will not be observed in Cloud Manager. The status can however be observed via Developer Console. This will be addressed in an upcoming release.

* The link to the Developer Console directly from Cloud Manager will not display the option to de-hibernate/hibernate a Sandbox Program's environment. To address this, once at the Developer Console, add the pattern `#release-cm-p1234-e5678` to the end of the url, where *1234* is the Program ID and *5678* is the Environment ID. This will be addressed in an upcoming release.
