# Code Quality Testing {#code-quality-testing}

The Code Quality Testing evaluates the quality of your application code. It is the core objective of a Code-Quality only pipeline  and is executed immediately following the build step in all non-production and production pipelines. 

Refer to [Configuring your CI-CD Pipeline](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/configure-pipeline.md) to learn more about different types of pipelines.

## Understanding Custom Code Quality Rules {#understanding-code-quality-rules}

In Code Quality Testing, the source code is scanned to ensure that it meets certain quality criteria. Currently, this is implemented by a combination of SonarQube and content package-level examination using OakPAL. There are over 100 rules combining generic Java rules and AEM-specific rules. Some of the AEM-specific rules are created based on best practices from AEM Engineering and are referred to as [Custom Code Quality Rules](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/custom-code-quality-rules.md).

>[!NOTE]
>You can download the complete list of rules [here](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/assets/CodeQuality-rules-latest.xlsx).

The results of this step is delivered as *Rating*. The following table summarizes the rating for testing criteria:

|Name|Definition|Category|Failure Threshold|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Security Rating|A = 0 Vulnerability <br/>B = at least 1 Minor Vulnerability<br/> C = at least 1 Major Vulnerability <br/>D = at least 1 Critical Vulnerability <br/>E = at least 1 Blocker Vulnerability|Critical|&lt; B|
|Reliability Rating|A = 0 Bug <br/>B = at least 1 Minor Bug <br/>C = at least 1 Major Bug <br/>D = at least 1 Critical Bug E = at least 1 Blocker Bug|Important|&lt; C|
|Maintainability Rating|Outstanding remediation cost for code smells is: <br/><ul><li>&lt;=5% of the time that has already gone into the application, the rating is A </li><li>between 6 to 10% the rating is a B </li><li>between 11 to 20% the rating is a C </li><li>between 21 to 50% the rating is a D</li><li>anything over 50% is an E</li></ul>|Important|&lt; A|
|Coverage|A mix of unit test line coverage and condition coverage using this formula: <br/>`Coverage = (CT + CF + LC)/(2*B + EL)`  <br/>where: CT = conditions that have been evaluated to 'true' at least once while running unit tests <br/>CF = conditions that have been evaluated to 'false' at least once while running unit tests <br/>LC = covered lines = lines_to_cover - uncovered_lines <br/><br/> B = total number of conditions <br/>EL = total number of executable lines (lines_to_cover)|Important|&lt; 50%|
|Skipped Unit Tests|Number of skipped unit tests.|Info|> 1|
|Open Issues|Overall issue types - Vulnerabilities, Bugs, and Code Smells|Info|&gt; 0|
|Duplicated Lines|Number of lines involved in duplicated blocks. <br/>For a block of code to be considered as duplicated: <br/><ul><li>**Non-Java projects:**</li><li>There should be at least 100 successive and duplicated tokens.</li><li>Those tokens should be spread at least on: </li><li>30 lines of code for COBOL </li><li>20 lines of code for ABAP </li><li>10 lines of code for other languages</li><li>**Java projects:**</li><li> There should be at least 10 successive and duplicated statements whatever the number of tokens and lines.</li></ul> <br/>Differences in indentation as well as in string literals are ignored while detecting duplications.|Info|&gt; 1%|
|Cloud Service Compatibility|Number of identified Cloud Service Compatibility issues.|Info|> 0|

## Dealing with False Positives {#dealing-with-false-positives}

The quality scanning process is not perfect and will sometimes incorrectly identify issues which are not actually problematic. This is referred to as a "false positive".

In these cases, the source code can be annotated with the standard Java `@SuppressWarnings` annotation specifying the rule ID as the annotation attribute. For example, one common problem is that the SonarQube rule to detect hardcoded passwords can be aggressive about how a hardcoded password is identified.

To look at a specific example, this code would be fairly common in an AEM project which has code to connect to some external service:

```java
@Property(label = "Service Password")
private static final String PROP_SERVICE_PASSWORD = "password";
```

SonarQube will then raise a Blocker Vulnerability. After reviewing the code, you identify that this is not a vulnerability and can annotate this with the appropriate rule id.

```java
@SuppressWarnings("squid:S2068")
@Property(label = "Service Password")
private static final String PROP_SERVICE_PASSWORD = "password";
```

However, on the other hand, if the code was actually this:

```java
@Property(label = "Service Password", value = "mysecretpassword")
private static final String PROP_SERVICE_PASSWORD = "password";
```

Then the correct solution is to remove the hardcoded password.

>[!NOTE]

>While it is a best practice to make the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation as specific as possible, i.e. annotate only the specific statement or block causing the issue, it is possible to annotate at a class level.

>While there is no explicit Security Testing step,  there are still security-related code quality rules evaluated during the code quality step. Refer to [Security Overview for AEM as a Cloud Service](/help/security/cloud-service-security-overview.md) to learn more about security in Cloud Service.
