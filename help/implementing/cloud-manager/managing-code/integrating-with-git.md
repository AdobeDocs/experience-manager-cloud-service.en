# Using git with Cloud Manager {#git-integration}

Adobe Cloud Manager comes provisioned with a single git repository that is used to deploy code using Cloud Manager's CI/CD pipelines. 

You can use Cloud Manager's git repository out of the box, but you also have the option of integrating a customer-managed git repository with Cloud Manager.

## Git Integration Overview {#git-integration-overview}

This video series explores several use cases when integrating a customer-managed git repository with Cloud Manager, including:

* [Initial Sync](#initial-sync)
* [Basic Branching Strategy](#branching-strategy)
* [Feature Branch Development](#feature-development)
* [Production Deployment](#production-deployment)
* [Synchronizing Release Tags](#sync-tags)

The video series assumes a basic knowledge of git and source control management. See the [additional resources below](#additional-resources) for more details on git.
