# Introduction to production programs {#production-programs}

A production program is intended for a team that is ready to start writing, building, and testing code with the objective of deploying it to host live traffic. 

After you [create your production program](creating-production-programs.md), a [program creation wizard](using-the-wizard.md) guides the user through selections depending on the user's objective in creating the program.

## Program creation options {#program-creation-options}

Your contractual agreement with Adobe defines the number and types of solutions available to your specific organization when creating production programs. You have control over how to map the available solutions to Cloud Manager programs. 

The following table describes common scenarios of available solutions and the typical production programs created based on them.
