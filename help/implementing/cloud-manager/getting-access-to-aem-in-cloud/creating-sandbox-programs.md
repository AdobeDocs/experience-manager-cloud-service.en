# Create sandbox programs {#create-sandbox-program}

A sandbox program is typically created to serve the purposes of training, running demos, enablement, POCs, or documentation, and is not meant to carry live traffic. See [Introduction to sandbox programs](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/introduction-sandbox-programs.md).

Learn more about program types in the document [Understanding Program and Program Types](program-types.md).

## Create a sandbox program {#create}

1. Log on to Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization.
 
1. On the **[My Programs](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/navigation.md#my-programs)** console, near the upper-right corner, click **Add Program**.

1. Under **Program Objective**, select **`Set up a sandbox`**.

1. (Optional) In the lower-right corner of the wizard dialog box, do either one of the following:

   * Drag and drop an image file onto the **Add a program image** target.
   * Click **Add a program image**, then select an image from a file browser.
   * Click the trash can icon to delete an image that you added.
   
1. Click **Continue**.

1. In the **Solutions &amp; Add-ons** list box, select one or more solutions to include in the program.
   
   * Click the chevron to the left of a solution name to reveal any available optional add-ons that you want to include with a selected solution.
   * The **Sites**, **Assets**, and **Edge Deliver Servicesy** solutions are always selected by default when you create a sandbox program. You cannot de-select them.

## Sandbox access {#access}

After a new sandbox program is finished being created, you can view the detail of your sandbox setup and access the environment by viewing the program overview page.

1. From the Cloud Manager landing page, click the ellipsis button on your created sandbox program.
