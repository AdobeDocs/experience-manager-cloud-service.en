# Build Environment {#build-environment} 

Learn about Cloud Manager's build environment and how it builds and tests your code.

## Build Environment Details {#build-environment-details}

Cloud Manager builds and tests your code using a specialized build environment.

* The build environment is Linux-based, derived from Ubuntu 18.04.
* Apache Maven 3.6.0 is installed.
* The Java versions installed are Oracle JDK 8u202 and Oracle JDK 11.0.2.
* By default, the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_202`  which contains Oracle JDK 8u202. See [Alternate Maven Execution JDK Version](#alternate-maven-jdk-version) section for more details.
* There are some additional system packages installed which are necessary.

  * `bzip2`
  * `unzip`
  * `libpng`
  * `imagemagick`
  * `graphicsmagick`

* Other packages may be installed at build time as described in the section [Installing Additional System Packages.](#installing-additional-system-packages)
* Every build is done on a pristine environment; the build container does not keep any state between executions.
* Maven is always run with the following three commands.

 * `mvn --batch-mode org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:3.1.2:resolve-plugins`
 * `mvn --batch-mode org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:3.1.0:clean -Dmaven.clean.failOnError=false`
 * `mvn --batch-mode org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent package`
* Maven is configured at a system level with a `settings.xml` file, which automatically includes the public Adobe artifact repository using a profile named `adobe-public`. (See [Adobe Public Maven Repository](https://repo1.maven.org/) for more details).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Although Cloud Manager does not define a specific version of the `jacoco-maven-plugin`, the version used must be at least `0.7.5.201505241946`.

### Using a Specific Java Version {#using-java-support}

By default, projects are built by the Cloud Manager build process using the Oracle 8 JDK. Customers wishing to use an alternate JDK have two options.

* [Use Maven Toolchains.](#maven-toolchains)
* [Select an alternate JDK version for the entire Maven execution process.](#alternate-maven-jdk-version)

#### Maven Toolchains {#maven-toolchains}

The [Maven Toolchains Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-toolchains-plugin/) allows projects to select a specific JDK (or toolchain) to be used in the context of toolchains-aware Maven plugins. This is done in the project's `pom.xml` file by specifying a vendor and version value.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-toolchains-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.1</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>toolchain</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <toolchains>
            <jdk>
                <version>11</version>
                <vendor>oracle</vendor>
            </jdk>
        </toolchains>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

This will cause all toolchains-aware Maven plugins to use the Oracle JDK, version 11.

When using this method, Maven itself still runs using the default JDK (Oracle 8) and the `JAVA_HOME`  environment variable is not changed. Therefore checking or enforcing the Java version through plugins like the Apache Maven Enforcer Plugin does not work and such plugins must not be used.

The currently available vendor/version combinations are:

|Vendor|Version|
|---|---|
|`oracle`|`8`|
|`oracle`|`11`|
|`sun`|`8`|
|`sun`|`11`|

This table refers to the product version numbers. Java build numbers or installation paths may reflect old Java version conventions such as 1.8 for Java 8.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Starting April 2022, Oracle JDK will be the default JDK for the development and operation of AEM applications. Cloud Manager's build process will automatically switch to using Oracle JDK, even if an alternative option is explicitly selected in the Maven toolchain. Please refer to the April release notes once published for further details.

#### Alternate Maven Execution JDK Version {#alternate-maven-jdk-version}

It is also possible to select Java 8 or Java 11 as the JDK for the entire Maven execution. Unlike the toolchains options, this changes the JDK used for all plugins unless the toolchains configuration is also  set in which case the toolchains configuration is still applied for toolchains-aware Maven plugins. As a result, checking and enforcing the Java version using the [Apache Maven Enforcer Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/maven-enforcer-plugin/) will work.

To do this, create a file named `.cloudmanager/java-version` in the git repository branch used by the pipeline. This file can have either the content 11 or 8. Any other value is ignored. If 11 is specified, Oracle 11 is used and the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.2`. If 8 is specified, Oracle 8 is used and the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_202`.

## Environment Variables {#environment-variables}

### Standard Environment Variables {#standard-environ-variables}

You may find it necessary to vary the build process based on information about the program or pipeline. 

For example, if build-time JavaScript minification is being done through a tool like gulp, there may be a desire to use a different minification level when building for a development environment as opposed to building for staging and production. 

To support this, Cloud Manager adds these standard environment variables to the build container for every execution.

| Variable Name | Definition |
|---|---|
| `CM_BUILD` |  Always set to `true` | 
| `BRANCH` | The configured branch for the execution  |
| `CM_PIPELINE_ID` |  The numeric pipeline identifier | 
| `CM_PIPELINE_NAME` |  The pipeline name | 
| `CM_PROGRAM_ID` |  The numeric program identifier | 
| `CM_PROGRAM_NAME` |  The program name | 
| `ARTIFACTS_VERSION` |  For a stage or production pipeline, the synthetic version generated by Cloud Manager | 
| `CM_AEM_PRODUCT_VERSION` |  The release version |

### Pipeline Variables {#pipeline-variables}

Your build process may depend upon specific configuration variables which would be inappropriate to place in the git repository or you may need to vary them between pipeline executions using the same branch. 

Cloud Manager allows for these variables to be configured through the Cloud Manager API or Cloud Manager CLI on a per-pipeline basis. Variables may be stored as either plain text or encrypted at rest. In either case, variables are made available inside the build environment as an environment variable which can then be referenced from inside the `pom.xml` file or other build scripts. 

This CLI command sets a variable.

```shell
$ aio cloudmanager:set-pipeline-variables PIPELINEID --variable MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE test
```

This command lists variables.

```shell
$ aio cloudmanager:list-pipeline-variables PIPELINEID
```

Variable names must observe the following conventions.

* Variables may only contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore (`_`).
* The names should be all upper-case.
* There is a limit of 200 variables per pipeline.
* Each name must be less than 100 characters.
* Each `string` variable value must be less than 2048 characters.
* Each `secretString` type variable value must be less than 500 characters.

When used inside a Maven `pom.xml` file, it is typically helpful to map these variables to Maven properties using a syntax similar to this.

```xml
        <profile>
            <id>cmBuild</id>
            <activation>
                <property>
                    <name>env.CM_BUILD</name>
                </property>
            </activation>
            <properties>
                <my.custom.property>${env.MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE}</my.custom.property> 
            </properties>
        </profile>
```

## Installing Additional System Packages {#installing-additional-system-packages}

Some builds require additional system packages to be installed to function fully. For example, a build may invoke a Python or Ruby script and will need to have an appropriate language interpreter installed. This can be done by calling the [`exec-maven-plugin`](https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/) in your `pom.xml` to invoke APT. This execution should generally be wrapped in a Cloud Manager-specific Maven profile. This example installs Python.

```xml
        <profile>
            <id>install-python</id>
            <activation>
                <property>
                        <name>env.CM_BUILD</name>
                </property>
            </activation>
            <build>
                <plugins>
                    <plugin>
                        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
                        <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                        <version>1.6.0</version>
                        <executions>
                            <execution>
                                <id>apt-get-update</id>
                                <phase>validate</phase>
                                <goals>
                                    <goal>exec</goal>
                                </goals>
                                <configuration>
                                    <executable>apt-get</executable>
                                    <arguments>
                                        <argument>update</argument>
                                    </arguments>
                                </configuration>
                            </execution>
                            <execution>
                                <id>install-python</id>
                                <phase>validate</phase>
                                <goals>
                                    <goal>exec</goal>
                                </goals>
                                <configuration>
                                    <executable>apt-get</executable>
                                    <arguments>
                                        <argument>install</argument>
                                        <argument>-y</argument>
                                        <argument>--no-install-recommends</argument>
                                        <argument>python</argument>
                                    </arguments>
                                </configuration>
                            </execution>
                        </executions>
                    </plugin>
                </plugins>
            </build>
        </profile>
```

This same technique can be used to install language-specific packages, e.g. using `gem` for RubyGems or `pip` for Python Packages.

>Installing a system package in this manner does not install it in the runtime environment used for running Adobe Experience Manager. If you need a system package installed on the AEM environment, contact your Adobe Representative.
