# Understand Cloud Service content requests

## Introduction {#introduction}

Content requests refer to requests made to AEM Sites, including those requests related to Edge Delivery Services or customer-provided caching systems like a Content Delivery Network. These requests deliver content or data in HTML format through page views (for example, pages and Experience Fragments) or in JSON format through API calls in a headless manner. Content requests are counted either as a page view or five API calls, and are measured at the ingress of the first caching system to receive a content request. Certain HTTP requests are included or excluded for purposes of counting content requests. The full list of such included and excluded HTTP requests, and their technical definitions, are available in the documentation.

## About Cloud Service content requests {#understanding-cloud-service-content-requests}

For customers using the out-of-the-box CDN, Cloud Service content requests are measured via server-side collection of data. This collection is enabled via CDN log analysis. AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) as a Cloud Service automatically collects content requests server-side at the edge. It analyzes log files generated by the AEM as a Cloud Service CDN. This process is done by isolating the requests returning HTML `(text/html)` or JSON `(application/json)` content from the CDN, and is based on several inclusion and exclusion rules detailed below. A content request occurs regardless of whether the content is served from the CDN caches or returned to the CDN origin (AEM's dispatchers).

<!-- REMOVED AS PER EMAIL REQUEST FROM SHWETA DUA, JULY 30, 2024 TO RICK BROUGH AND ALEXANDRU SARCHIZ   For customers employing their own CDN, client-side collection offers a more precise reflection of interactions, ensuring a reliable measure of website engagement via the [Real Use Monitoring](/help/sites-cloud/administering/real-use-monitoring-for-aem-as-a-cloud-service.md) service. This gives customers advanced insights into their page traffic and performance. While it is beneficial for all customers, it offers a representative reflection of user interactions, ensuring a reliable measure of website engagement by capturing the number of page views from the client side. 

For customers that bring their own CDN on top of AEM as a Cloud Service, server-side reporting results in numbers that cannot be used to compare with the licensed content requests. With the [Real Use Monitoring](/help/sites-cloud/administering/real-use-monitoring-for-aem-as-a-cloud-service.md), Adobe can reflect a reliable measure of website engagement. --> 

### Variances of Cloud Service content requests {#content-requests-variances}

Content requests can have variances within an organization's Analytics reporting tools as summarized in the following table. In general, avoid using analytics tools that rely on client-side instrumentation to report the number of content requests for a site. These tools often miss a large portion of traffic because they depend on user consent to be activated. Analytics tools gathering data server-side in log files, or CDN reports for customers adding their own CDN on top of AEM as a Cloud Service, provide better counts. 

|Reason For Variance|Explanation|
|---|---|
|End user consent|Analytics tools relying on client-side instrumentation often depend on user consent to be triggered. This workflow could represent the majority of the traffic not being tracked. For customers who want to measure content requests on their own, it is recommended to rely on analytics tools gathering data server-side or CDN reports.|
|Tagging|All pages or API calls that are tracked as Adobe Experience Manager content requests may not be tagged with Analytics tracking.|
|Tag Management Rules|Tag management rule settings may result in various data collection configurations on a page, resulting in some combination of discrepancies with content request tracking.|
|Bots|Unknown bots that AEM has not pre-identified and removed may cause tracking discrepancies.|
|Report Suites|Pages that are part of the same AEM instance and domain may send data to different Analytics report suites.|
|Third-Party Monitoring and Security Tools|Monitoring and security scanning tools may generate content requests for AEM that are not tracked in Analytics reports.|
|API Access|Programmatic access to pages or to Adobe Experience Manager APIs may generate content requests for AEM that are not tracked in Analytics reports.|
|Prefetch Requests|Using a prefetch service to pre-load pages to increase speed can cause significant content request traffic increases.|
|DDOS|While Adobe makes attempts to detect and filter out traffic automatically from DDOS attacks, there is no guarantee that all possible DDOS attacks are detected.|
|Traffic Blockers|Using a tracker blocker in a browser may opt out some requests from being tracked.|
|Firewalls|Firewalls may block Analytics tracking. This scenario is more frequent with corporate firewalls.|

## Server-side collection rules {#serverside-collection}

There are rules in place to exclude well-known bots, including well-known services visiting the site regularly to refresh their search index or service.

### Types of included content requests {#included-content-requests}

| Request Type | Content Request | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP Code 100-299 | Included | Regular requests that deliver all or partial content. |
| HTTP libraries for automation | Included | Examples:<br>&bull; Amazon CloudFront<br>&bull; Apache Http Client<br>&bull; Asynchronous HTTP Client<br>&bull; Axios<br>&bull; Azureus<br>&bull; Curl<br>&bull; GitHub Node Fetch<br>&bull; Guzzle<br>&bull; Go-http-client<br>&bull; Headless Chrome<br>&bull; Java&trade; Client<br>&bull; Jersey<br>&bull; Node Oembed<br>&bull; okhttp<br>&bull; Python Requests<br>&bull; Reactor Netty<br>&bull; Wget<br>&bull; WinHTTP<br>&bull; Fast HTTP<br>&bull; GitHub Node Fetch<br>&bull; Reactor Netty|
| Monitoring and Health Check tools | Included | Set up by the customer to monitor a certain aspect of the site. For example, availability or real-world user performance. If they are targeting specific endpoints like `/system/probes/health` for health checks, Adobe recommends that you use `/system/probes/health` endpoint and not the actual HTML pages from the site. [See below](#excluded-content-request)<br>Examples:<br>&bull; `Amazon-Route53-Health-Check-Service`<br>&bull; EyeMonIT_bot_version_0.1_[(https://eyemonit.com/)](https://eyemonit.com/)<br>&bull; Investis-Site24x7<br>&bull; Mozilla/5.0+(compatible; UptimeRobot/2.0; [https://uptimerobot.com/](https://uptimerobot.com/))<br>&bull; ThousandEyes-Dragonfly-x1<br>&bull; OmtrBot/1.0<br>&bull; WebMon/2.0.0|
| `<link rel="prefetch">` requests | Included | To increase the speed of loading the next page, customers can have the browser load a set of pages before the user clicks the link&mdash;so they are already in the cache. *Mind: This approach increases the traffic significantly*&mdash;depending on how many of these pages are prefetched.|
| Traffic that blocks Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics reporting | Included | It is more common that visitors of sites have privacy software installed (Ad-blockers, and so on) that impact the accuracy of Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics. AEM as a Cloud Service counts requests on the first entry-point into the Adobe operated infrastructure and not the client-side.|

### Types of excluded content requests {#excluded-content-request}

| Request Type | Content Request | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP Code 500+ | Excluded | Errors returned to the visitor when something goes wrong on AEM as a Cloud Service or the customer custom code.|
| HTTP Code 400-499 | Excluded | Errors returned to the visitor when the content does not exist (404) or there are other content or request-related issues.|
| HTTP Code 300-399 | Excluded | Good requests that either check if something has changed on the server, or redirect the request to another resource. They do not contain content itself, therefore they are not billable.|
| Requests going to /libs/* | Excluded | AEM internal JSON requests, such as the CSRF token that is not billable.|
| Traffic from DDOS attacks | Excluded | DDOS protection. AEM does auto-detect some of the DDOS attacks and blocks them. DDOS attacks if detected are not billable. |
| AEM as a Cloud Service New Relic Monitoring | Excluded | AEM as a Cloud Service global monitoring.|
| URL for customers to monitor their Cloud Service program | Excluded | Adobe recommends that you use the URL to monitor the availability or health check externally.<br><br>`/system/probes/health`|
| AEM as a Cloud Service Pod Warm-up Service | Excluded | 
Agent: skyline-service-warmup/1.*|
