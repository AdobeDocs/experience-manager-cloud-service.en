# Checking Status of an SSL Certificate {#checking-status-an-ssl-certificate}

The status of your SSL certificates can be understood at a glance from the SSL certificate page.

You can identify the status of an SSL certificate from the following color schemes:

* **Green** 
   Indicates that your certificate is valid for at least 60 days into the future.

* **Orange** 
   Indicates that your certificate is due to expire in under 60 days. It is time to ensure you have a plan to renew your certificate and replace it via Cloud Manager UI in order to avoid possible site access or outages. Cloud Manager will send regular notifications in the UI to alert you of an impending certificate expiration.

* **Red** 
   Indicates that despite multiple notifications, your SSL certificate has expired.
