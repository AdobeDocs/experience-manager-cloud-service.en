# Navigate the Cloud Manger UI {#navigation}

Learn how the Cloud Manager UI is organized and how to navigate to manage your programs and environments.

The Cloud manage UI is primarily composed of two graphical interfaces:

* [The My Programs console](#my-programs-console) is where you can view and manage all of your programs.
* [The Program Overview window](#program-overview) is where you can see the detail of and manage an individual program.

>[!TIP]
>
>Also check out the [onboarding documentation journey](/help/journey-onboarding/overview.md) for a complete overview of how to get up-and-running with AEM as a Cloud Service using Cloud Manager.

## My Programs Console {#my-programs-console}

When you log into Cloud Manager at at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization, you arrive at the **My Programs** console.

![My Programs console](assets/my-programs-console.png)

The My Programs console provides an overview of all programs to which you have access in the selected organization. It is made up of several parts.

1. [Toolbars](#toolbars-my-programs-toolbars) for organization selection, alerts, and account settings
1. Tabs that allow you to toggle the current view of your programs.
   * **Home** view (default) that selects the **My Programs** view with an overview of all programs
   * **License** that accesses the [License Dashboard](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/license-dashboard.md).
   * Note that the tabs default to closed and can be revealed using the hamburger menu in the [Cloud Manager header](#cloud-manager-header).
1. [Statistics and call-to-action](#statistics) for an overview of your recent activity
1. [**My Programs** section](#my-programs-section) with an overview of all your programs
1. [Quick links](#quick-links-section) to access related resources easily.

>[!TIP]
>
>Please see the document [Programs and Program Types](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/program-types.md) for details on programs.

### Toolbars {#my-programs-toolbars}

There are two toolbars on top of each other. 

#### Cloud Manager header {#cloud-manager-header}

The first is the Cloud Manager header, which is persistent as you navigate Cloud Manager. It is an anchor that gives you access to settings and information that apply across Cloud Manager programs.

![The Experience Cloud header](assets/experience-cloud-header.png)

1. Click ![Show menu icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_ShowMenu_18_N.svg) (show or hide side menu) to give you access to a variety of tabs that can take you to specific parts of an individual program. Or, you can switch between the [License Dashboard](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/license-dashboard.md) and the **[My Programs](#my-programs-console)** console depending on the context.
1. Click the Adobe Cloud Manager button takes you back to the My Programs console of Cloud Manager no matter where you are in Cloud Manager.
1. Click **Feedback** to provide feedback to Adobe about Cloud Manager.
1. Click the organization selector displays the organization that you are currently signed into (in this example, Foundation Internal). Click to switch to another organization if your Adobe ID is associated with multiple.
1. Click ![Apps icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Apps_18_N.svg) (Solutions switcher) to jump quickly to other Experience Cloud solutions.
1. Click ![Help icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Help_18_N.svg) to give you quick access to learning and support resources.
1. Click ![Bell icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Bell_18_N.svg) ([Notifications](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/notifications.md)) to see notifications and announcements, among other things.
1. Click the icon representing user access to your user settings. If you do not have a user picture configured, an icon is randomly assigned.

#### Program toolbar {#program-toolbar}

The program toolbar provides links to switch between Cloud Manager programs and actions appropriate to the context.

![Program toolbar](assets/program-toolbar.png)

1. The **My Programs** selector opens a drop-down where you can select other programs quickly or take context-appropriate actions such as creating a new program
1. The **Getting Started** link gives you access to the [onboarding documentation journey](/help/journey-onboarding/overview.md) to get you up-and-running with Cloud Manager.
1. The action button offers context-appropriate actions such as adding a program.

### Statistics and call-to-actions {#statistics}

The statistics and call-to-action section provides aggregate data for your organization, for example, if you have successfully set up your programs, statistics of your activities over the past 90 days might show, including:

* Number of [deployments](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/deploy-code.md)
* Number of [code quality issues](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/code-quality-testing.md) identified
* Number of builds

Or if you are just beginning the setup of your org, there might be tips on next steps or documentation resources.

### My Programs section {#my-programs-section}

The main content of the **My Programs** console is the list of programs in the **My Programs** section.

The **My Programs** section lists cards representing each program. Tap or click on a card to access the **Program Overview** page of the program for details about the program.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Depending on your privileges, you may not be able to select certain programs.


To find the program you need more easily, use the sorting options.

![Sorting options](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/assets/my-programs-sorting.png)

* Sort by:
  * **Date Created** (default)
  * **Program Name**
  * **Status**
* ![Sort order down icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_SortOrderDown_18_N.svg) Ascending (default) / ![Sort order up icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_SortOrderUp_18_N.svg) Descending
