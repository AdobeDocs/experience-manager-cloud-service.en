Cloud Manager allows you to add a custom domain to identify your site with a unique, branded name in a self-service manner via the UI. Your Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service is provisioned with a default domain name, ending in `*.adobeaemcloud.com`. This default domain name remains, even after you attach custom domain names to your website.

>[!NOTE]
>Custom Domain names are supported in Cloud Manager for Sites Programâ€™s (Publish service) only. Each Cloud Manager Environment can host up to a maximum of 250 custom domains per environment. AEM as a Cloud Service does not support wildcard domains.

Using the Cloud Manager UI Domain Settings page, or the Environment Details page, a user with permissions can perform several tasks to manage custom domain names for your environments, including:

* [Adding a Custom Domain Name](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/custom-domain-names/add-custom-domain-name.md)
* [Viewing or Updating a Custom Domain Name](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/custom-domain-names/view-update-replace-custom-domain-name.md) that allows a user to view details or to replace a certificate that is about to expire
* [Deleting a Custom Domain Name](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/custom-domain-names/delete-custom-domain-name.md)
