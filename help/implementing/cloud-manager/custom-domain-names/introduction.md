# Introduction {#introduction}

Cloud Manager allows you to add a custom domain to identify your site with a unique, branded name in a self-service manner via the UI. Your AEMaaCS is provisioned with a default domain name, ending in `*.adobearmcloud.com`. This default domain name remains, even after you attach custom domain names to your website. 

>[!NOTE]
>Custom Domain names are supported in Cloud Manager for Sites Programâ€™s (Publish service) only. Each CM Environment can host up to a maximum of 50 custom domains per environment.

Using the Cloud Manager UI Domain Settings page, or the Environment Details page, a user with permissions can perform several tasks to manage custom domain names for your environments, including:

* Adding a custom domain name INSERT LINK
* Viewing or Updating custom domain name that allows a user to view details or to replace a certificate that is about to expire.INSERT LINK
* Deleting custom domain name. INSERT LINK
