# Getting a Custom Domain Name {#getting-cdn}

You can buy a domain name from a domain name registrar, a company or organization managing and selling domain names. Domain name registrars manage domain names on Domain Name System (DNS) servers. 

>[!NOTE]
>Cloud Manager is not a domain name registrar and does not provide DNS services.

DNS is what allows us to have custom, branded domains attached to websites by translating machine-readable computer addresses, such as `184.33.123.64` to memorable addresses such as `www.wknd.com`.
