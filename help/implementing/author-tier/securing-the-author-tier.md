# Securing the Author Tier {#securing-the-author-tier}

When creating an environment with AEM as a Cloud Service, the resulting author tier is accessible from the Internet by default. It is possible to configure the network policies further to secure the access to your author tier. See [Applying an IP Allow List](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/ip-allow-lists/apply-allow-list.html) for more details. The procedure is based on authorizing the IP ranges that should be granted network access to your author environment. 

To put these rules in place, file a Support ticket, from the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) with the requested information:

* program ID
* environment ID
* IP address ranges to authorize
