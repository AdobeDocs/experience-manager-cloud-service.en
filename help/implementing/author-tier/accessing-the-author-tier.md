# Accessing the Author Tier {#accessing-the-author-tier}

Accessing the author tier of an AEM as a Cloud Service environment is done via a standard and non customizable URL.

The URL format is currently as follows:

* `https://author-p[Program ID]-e[EnvironmentID].adobeaemcloud.com/`

Eventually, this format will be replaced with a standard Adobe Experience Cloud URL format:

* `https://experience.adobe.com/#/@[TenantId]/`

Therefore it is not supported to configure custom domain names for the AEM author tier.
