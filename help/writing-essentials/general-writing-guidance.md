# Writing guidance for Adobe documentation

These guidelines apply whether you are creating new documentation or updating existing documentation.

Please do the following:

- Check the spelling and grammar in your articles.
- Use a friendly tone.
- Use simple sentences. They are easier to understand and translate into other languages.

## Styles guidelines

Keep the following in mind when writing documentation.

- **Write concisely**: Don't waste words. Keep sentences short and concise. Keep your article focused. Keep the number of notes to a minimum.
- **Focus on the audience and purpose**: Before you begin writing, clearly determine who the customer is and what task he or she is trying to accomplish. Write your article to help that customer do that task.
- **Use examples**: Provide examples to explain concepts.
- **Organize your content**: Create sections to divide instructions into more manageable groups of steps. Use a screenshot when it adds clarity.
