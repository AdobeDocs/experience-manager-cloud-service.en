## Introduction {#introduction}

Instances of Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service, and the applications that run on them, are owned and operated by our customers.

As a consequence, data protection regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, and others, are largely the responsibility of the customers.

As a very brief introduction, the regulations for data privacy and protection include new rules to be followed by the roles of:

* Business Entities (CCPA) and/or Data Controllers (GDPR) 

* Service Providers (CCPA) and/or Data Processors (GDPR) 

The main provisions in such regulations are:

1. Expanded definition of personal data to include all unique IDs; as in directly and indirectly identifiable data.

2. Strengthened consent requirements.

3. Increased focus on deletion rights (Data Erasure).

4. Opt-Out of Sale of Data.

For Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service:

* The instances, and applications that run on them, are owned and operated by the customer. 

  * This effectively means that the customer manages the regulatory roles, including Business Entities and Service Provider, Data Controller, and Data Processor, amongst others. 

  * The Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service will not be part of the workflow for AEM, as illustrated in the diagram below. 

* AEM includes documentation and procedures for the customer's privacy administrator and/or AEM administrator to execute the privacy regulation requests; either manually or through APIs, when available.

* No new service or UI has been added.

  * Instead procedures and APIs are documented for use by the customer UIs/portals that handle privacy regulation requests.

* AEM will not include any out-of-the-box tooling to support the privacy requests workflow. 

  * Adobe will provide documentation and procedures for the customer's privacy administrator and/or AEM administrator, enabling them to manually execute requests related to the privacy regulations.

Adobe is providing procedures for handling privacy requests related to Access, Delete and Opt-Out for Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. In some cases, there are APIs available that can be called from a customer developed portal or scripts to help with automation.

The following diagram illustrates what a privacy request workflow might look like (illustrated using Adobe Experience Manager 6.5):
