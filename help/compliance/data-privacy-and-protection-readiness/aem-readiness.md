Adobe is providing documentation and procedures (with APIs when available) for the customer privacy administrator or AEM administrator. This documentation helps administrators handle data protection and data privacy requests and help Adobe customers be compliant with these regulations. The procedures documented let customers run the regulatory requests manually or call into APIs, where available, from an external portal or service.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Instances of Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service, and the applications that run on them, are owned and operated by Adobe customers.

As a consequence, data protection regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, and others, are largely the responsibility of the customers.

As a brief introduction, the regulations for data privacy and protection include new rules to be followed by the roles of:

* Business Entities (CCPA) and/or Data Controllers (GDPR) 

* Service Providers (CCPA) and/or Data Processors (GDPR) 

The main provisions in such regulations are:

1. Expanded definition of personal data to include all unique IDs; as in directly and indirectly identifiable data.

2. Strengthened consent requirements.

3. Increased focus on deletion rights (Data Erasure).

4. Opt-Out of Sale of Data.

For Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service:

* The instances, and applications that run on them, are owned and operated by the customer. 

  * This ownership effectively means that the customer manages the regulatory roles, including Business Entities and Service Provider, Data Controller, and Data Processor, among others. 

  * The Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service is not part of the workflow for AEM, as illustrated in the diagram below. 

* AEM includes documentation and procedures for the customer's privacy administrator and/or AEM administrator to execute the privacy regulation requests; either manually or through APIs, when available.

* No new service or UI has been added.

  * Instead procedures and APIs are documented for use by the customer UIs/portals that handle privacy regulation requests.

* AEM does not include any out-of-the-box tooling to support the privacy requests workflow. 

  * Adobe provides documentation and procedures for the customer's privacy administrator, or AEM administrator, or both, enabling them to manually run requests related to the privacy regulations.

Adobe is providing procedures for handling privacy requests related to Access, Delete, and Opt-Out for Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. Sometimes, there are APIs available that can be called from a customer developed portal or scripts to help with automation.

The following diagram illustrates what a privacy request workflow might look like (illustrated using Adobe Experience Manager 6.5):
