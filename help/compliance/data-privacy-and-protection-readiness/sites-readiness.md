## AEM Author Tier {#aem-author-tier}

User accounts and UGC content on the author server are covered in the [AEM Foundation documentation](/help/compliance/data-privacy-and-protection-readiness/foundation-readiness.md).

## AEM Publish Tier {#aem-publish-tier}

## ContextHub {#contexthub}

<!--
AEM provides an optional data layer with [ContextHub](/help/sites-developing/contexthub.md).
-->

AEM provides an optional data layer with ContextHub. This keeps visitor-specific data in the browser, to be used for rules-based personalization.

By default, this visitor-data is not stored in AEM; AEM sends rules to the data layer to make personalization decisions in the browser.

### Implementing Opt-in/Opt-Out {#implementing-opt-in-opt-out}

The site owner needs to implement an opt-out component according to the following guidelines.

These guidelines implement opt-in as the default. Thus, a website visitor must clearly agree, before any personal data is stored in the browser's (client-side) persistence.

* The opt-out component should be included every time the ContextHub component is included.
* The terms and conditions that relate to data protection and privacy for the website, must be displayed to the website visitor, allowing them to:

    * accept
    * reject
    * change their previous choice

* If a site visitor accepts the site's terms and conditions, the ContextHub opt-out cookie should be removed:

  ```
  ContextHub.Utils.Cookie.removeItem('cq-opt-out');
  ```

* If a site visitor does not accept the site's terms and conditions, the ContextHub opt-out cookie should be set:

  ```
  ContextHub.Utils.Cookie.setItem('cq-opt-out', 1);
  ```

* To check whether ContextHub is running in opt-out mode, the following call should be made in the browser's console:

  ```
  var isOptedOut = ContextHub.isOptedOut(true) === true;
  // if isOptedOut is true, ContextHub is running in opt-out mode
  ```

### Previewing Persistence of ContextHub {#previewing-persistence-of-contexthub}

To preview persistance used ContextHub, a user can:

* Use the browser's console; for example:

    * Chrome:

        * Open Developer Tools &gt; Application &gt; Storage:

            * Local Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
            * Session Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
            * Cookies &gt; (website) &gt; SessionPersistence

    * Firefox:

        * Open Developer Tools &gt; Storage:

            * Local Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
            * Session Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
            * Cookies &gt; (website) &gt; SessionPersistence

    * Safari:

        * Open Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Show Develop menu in menu bar
        * Open Develop &gt; Show JavaScript Console

            * Console &gt; Storage &gt; Local Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
            * Console &gt; Storage &gt; Session Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
            * Console &gt; Storage &gt; Cookies &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence

    * Internet Explorer:

        * Open Developer Tools &gt; Console

            * `localStorage.getItem('ContextHubPersistence')`
            * `sessionStorage.getItem('ContextHubPersistence')`
            * `document.cookie`

* Use the ContextHub API, in the browser's console:

    * ContextHub provides following data persistence layers:

        * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.LOCAL` (default)
        * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.SESSION`
        * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.COOKIE`
        * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.WINDOW`

      The ContextHub store defines which persistence layer will be used, thus to view the current state of the persistence all layers should be checked.

For example, to view data stored in localStorage:

To preview persistance used ContextHub, a user can:

* Use the browser's console:

    * Chrome - open Developer Tools &gt; Application &gt; Storage:

        * Local Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
        * Session Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
        * Cookies &gt; (website) &gt; SessionPersistence

    * Firefox - open Developer Tools &gt; Storage:

        * Local Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
        * Session Storage &gt; (website) &gt; ContextHubPersistence
        * Cookies &gt; (website) &gt; SessionPersistence

* Use the ContextHub API, in the browser's console:

    * ContextHub provides following data persistence layers:

        * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.LOCAL` (default)
        * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.SESSION`
        * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.COOKIE`
        * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.WINDOW`

      The ContextHub store defines which persistence layer will be used, thus to view the current state of the persistence all layers should be checked.

For example, to view data stored in localStorage:

```
var storage = new ContextHub.Utils.Persistence({ mode: ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.LOCAL });
console.log(storage.getTree());
```

### Clearing Persistence of ContextHub {#clearing-persistence-of-contexthub}

To clear the ContextHub persistence:

* To clear persistence of currently loaded stores:

  ```
  // in order to be able to fully access persistence layer, Opt-Out must be turned off
  ContextHub.Utils.Cookie.removeItem('cq-opt-out');

  // following call asks all currently loaded stores to clear their data
  ContextHub.cleanAllStores();

  // following call asks all currently loaded stores to set back default values (provided in their configs)
  ContextHub.resetAllStores();

  ```

* To clear a specific persistence layer; for example, sessionStorage:

  ```
  var storage = new ContextHub.Utils.Persistence({ mode: ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.SESSION });
  storage.setItem('/store', null);
  storage.setItem('/_', null);

  // to confirm that nothing is stored:
  console.log(storage.getTree());
  ```

* To clear all ContextHub persistence layers, the appropriate code must be called for all layers:

    * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.LOCAL` (default)
    * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.SESSION`
    * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.COOKIE`
    * `ContextHub.Utils.Persistence.Modes.WINDOW`
