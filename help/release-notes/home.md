## How to Prepare for a Release {#how-to-prepare}

With the continuous release model in [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service, the application is auto updated on an ongoing basis. There are two types of updates, feature releases and maintenance releases:

* [Feature releases](/help/release-notes/release-notes-cloud/release-notes-current.md) are done with a predictable monthly frequency and are focused on new capabilities and product innovations.
* [Maintenance releases](/help/release-notes/maintenance/latest.md) are done frequently and are focused on security updates, bug fixes, and performance enhancements. This ensures that [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service is always up-to-date with any critical fixes.

In addition to the speed of innovation, [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service also provides the flexibility to preview upcoming features a full month in advance before the features are released into production. This lets you assess the impact of an upcoming release on their organization by test driving the features in your own custom environment and train/prepare the internal users well in advance. If you have an AEM add-on, such as forms, you can ensure that it gets updated as well by selecting the solution in the [program settings](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/creating-production-programs.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Prerelease is done only for monthly feature releases, not critical updates.
