## What's New {#what-is-new}

* **Forms Metadata Support:** Following the recent support for social media metadata in [release 2024.09.26 of the Universal Editor](/help/release-notes/universal-editor/2024/2024-09-26.md), the **Properties** panel now also supports field names with the `fd:` namespace for AEM Forms to be correctly encoded when stored.
  * This enables the insertion of AEM Forms metadata on EDS project pages.

## Early Adoption Program for 6.5 Support {#early-adoption}

The Universal Editor is now available for headless use cases when using AEM 6.5 as part of an early adopter program.
