## What's New {#what-is-new}

* **Native Delivery of CORS Library:** The Universal Editor Service now directly delivers the `universal-editor-cors` library, ensuring you always have the latest compatible version.
  * This eliminates the need for self-hosting or managing this library as an NPM dependency, simplifying the setup and maintenance process.

## Early Adoption Program for 6.5 Support {#early-adoption}

The Universal Editor is now available for headless use cases when using AEM 6.5 as part of an early adopter program.
