## What's New {#what-is-new}

* **Duplicate Components**: A new toolbar button lets authors [duplicate content](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/universal-editor/authoring.md#duplicating-components) with a single click, making it quick and efficient to create similar blocks by copying, modifying, and repositioning existing elements, simplifying repetitive content creation.
* **Content Picker Root Path**: The [AEM Content](/help/implementing/universal-editor/field-types.md#aem-content), [Content Fragment](/help/implementing/universal-editor/field-types.md#content-fragment) and [Experience Fragment](/help/implementing/universal-editor/field-types.md#experience-fragment), content pickers now support a `rootPath` configuration, limiting selection to the specified path and any subdirectories, maintaining content consistency and to increase author efficiency.
* **Cross-Container Drag &amp; Drop**: Moving components between different containers via drag-and-drop now respects component filters, ensuring content consistency
  * The [allowed components](/help/implementing/universal-editor/filtering.md) must be identical between the two containers.
* **Extension-Driven Selection**: [Extension developers](/help/implementing/universal-editor/extending.md) can now programmatically select content items.
  * This is exposed by the `guestConnection.host.editorActions.selectEditables(editables: Editable[]);` method.

## Early Adoption Program for 6.5 Support {#early-adoption}

The Universal Editor is now available for headless use cases when using AEM 6.5 as part of an early adopter program.

## Other Improvements {#other-improvements}

* **Enhanced Numeric and Enum Field Support**: Improved handling for decimal inputs, and added min/max limits to multi-fields to ensure consistency and accuracy in content entry
* **Improved Page Navigation**: Resolved issues where switching from non-UE pages to UE-enabled pages could cause editor failures
* **Content Picker URL Handling**: Fixed the content picker's handling of query parameters in AEM connection URLs, ensuring compatibility with specific URL branches or other GET parameters
* **Fixed Multi-Field References**: Addressed issues in Content Fragment multi-fields where null values were saved initially,  ensuring a seamless and consistent experience across the Universal Editor and Content Fragment Editor
* **Extended AppBuilder Timeout**: Increased timeout for AppBuilder extensions in slow connections and updated SDK, reducing load failures and enhancing stability
* **Improved Tooltip and Shortcuts**: Added missing tooltips and keyboard shortcuts for the **Add** toolbar option, enhancing usability for adding new components within containers
* **Optimized Theme Switching**: Enhanced re-rendering performance when switching themes, like enabling Dark Theme, for smoother UI transitions
