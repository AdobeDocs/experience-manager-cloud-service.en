## What's New {#what-is-new}

* **Custom Preview URLs**: [You can now specify a custom preview URL](/help/implementing/universal-editor/customizing.md#custom-preview-urls) via the `urn:adobe:aue:config:preview meta configuration`, which will open when clicking the **Open page** button [in the editor's top-right toolbar](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/universal-editor/navigation.md#universal-editor-toolbar).
  * This is particularly useful for applications with specific preview requirements, such as those [using Edge Delivery Services with WYSIWYG authoring](/help/edge/wysiwyg-authoring/authoring.md).
* **Content Fragment Validation**: Support was added for [validating Content Fragment fields](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-models.md#validation), allowing you to enforce data integrity rules such as regex patterns and uniqueness constraints.
  * This ensures that your content meets specific business requirements before it's published.

## Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes}

* **Refresh on Navigation**: An issue was resolved where editable fields weren't refreshing when navigating between pages, ensuring that all editable content overlays are consistently updated.
* **Asset Picker Stability**: The reliability of asset management within the editor was improved by fixing an issue where the Asset Picker would fail to function if the host wasn't set.
* **Consistent Tooltip Behavior**: The consistency of the UI was improved by unifying the visual aspect of tooltips in the toolbar, ensuring a user-friendly interface.
