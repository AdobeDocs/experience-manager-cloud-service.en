## Whatâ€™s New {#what-is-new}

* **Rollback Pipeline for Universal Editor Service:** A rollback pipeline enables Adobe's on-call teams to quickly revert the Universal Editor Service to any specific branch if needed, ensuring high availability through rapid recovery in case of issues.
* **Optimized API Calls for Content Operations:** The Universal Editor Service now uses JSON APIs instead of HTML APIs for create, copy, and move operations via the SlingPostServlet, streamlining the parsing of the responses.

## Early Adoption Program for 6.5 Support {#early-adoption}

The Universal Editor is now available for headless use cases when using AEM 6.5 as part of an early adopter program.
