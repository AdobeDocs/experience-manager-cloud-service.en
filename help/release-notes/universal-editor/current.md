## Whatâ€™s New {#what-is-new}

* **`rootPath` now available for the content picker**: The content picker can now be provided with a `rootPath` to present the user with a targeted selection of content when using [AEM Content,](/help/implementing/universal-editor/field-types.md#aem-content) [Content Fragment,](/help/implementing/universal-editor/field-types.md#content-fragment) and [Experience Fragment](/help/implementing/universal-editor/field-types.md#experience-fragment) field types.
  * Content selection is thereby limited to content in the configured directory and any subdirectories.

## Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes}

* **Cross-Container Drag &amp; Drop**: [Move components across different containers via drag and drop](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/universal-editor/authoring.md#reordering-components) now respects [component filters](/help/implementing/universal-editor/customizing.md#filtering-components) between the source and target.
