## Whatâ€™s New {#what-is-new}

* **Rollback Pipeline for Universal Editor Service:** A rollback pipeline enables Adobe's on-call teams to quickly revert the Universal Editor Service to any specific branch if needed, ensuring high availability through rapid recovery in case of issues.
* **Optimized API Calls for Content Operations:** The Universal Editor Service now uses JSON APIs instead of HTML APIs for create, copy, and move operations via the SlingPostServlet, streamlining the parsing of the responses.
* **Support for Universal Editor on AEM 6.5:** The Universal Editor is now available for headless use cases [when using AEM 6.5.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/implementing/developing/headless/universal-editor/introduction.html)
