# Release Notes for [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service 2020.7.0 {#release-notes}

The following section outlines the general Release Notes for Experience Manager as a Cloud Service 2020.7.0.

## Release Date {#release-date}

The release date for [!DNL Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service 2020.7.0 is July 30, 2020.

## Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service {#cloud-services-sites}

### What's New {#what-is-new-sites}

[!DNL Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service connectors for [!DNL Adobe Target] and [!DNL Adobe Analytics] are enhanced in the following ways:

* A new user interface implementation replaces the implementation based on the Classic UI.

* Simplified user interface dialogs, leaving framework creation for variable mapping and other configurations to [!DNL Adobe Launch]. See [Integrating Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/integrations/integrating-adobe-analytics.html) and [Integrating Adobe Target](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/integrations/integrating-adobe-target.html).

* Configurations are now stored in `/conf` rather than `/etc/cloudsettings` in the Experience Manager repository.

## [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] as a Cloud Service {#assets}

### What is new in [!DNL Assets] {#what-is-new-assets}

* [!DNL Asset Compute Service] is a scalable and extensible service to process assets. Administrators can configure [!DNL Experience Manager] to invoke custom applications created using the [!DNL Asset Compute Service]. Developers can use the service to create specialized custom applications that cater to complex use cases. This web service can generate thumbnails for different file types, high-quality image renderings from Adobe file formats, encode videos (future), extract metadata, extract full text as precursor for indexing, and run an asset through all available [!DNL Sensei] services. see [use asset microservices and processing profiles](/help/assets/asset-microservices-configure-and-use.md).

* The initial configuration of [!DNL Dynamic Media] in [!DNL Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service is improved to be more robust. It now provides progress of the processes to the administrators.

* Publishing of assets to [!DNL Dynamic Media] is simplified and made more robust by making it an integral part of overall asset processing pipeline using asset microservices and improving the batch publishing backend.

* Workflow steps that are not compatible with a Cloud Service deployment are now marked with a warning in the [!UICONTROL workflow model] editor. Additionally, when executing the existing workflows on Cloud Service environment, the incompatible workflow steps are skipped.

* Workflow models created by customers that are deployed to `/conf/global` in the Git project associated with the environment in [!DNL Cloud Manager] are automatically deployed to `/var` and thus available in [!DNL Experience Manager]. The product workflow models under `/libs` that were changed by customer are not automatically deployed to `/var`.

### Bugs fixed {#assets-bugs-fixed}

* The Move Asset wizard does not load as expected for the assets that are included in Collections. (CQ-4296756)
* The values of `dam:size` and `dam:sha1` are excluded from XMP writeback. (CQ-4237355)
* When unpublishing assets in bulk, [!DNL Brand Portal] generates an error suggesting that the request URI is too long. (CQ-4299474)
