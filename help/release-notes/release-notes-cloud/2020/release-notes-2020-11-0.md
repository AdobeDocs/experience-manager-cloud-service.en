## [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] as a Cloud Service {#assets}

### What is new in [!DNL Assets] and [!DNL Dynamic Media] {#what-is-new-assets}

* **Bulk asset ingestion**: Provide customers with a scalable, cloud-native ingestion service that leverages [!DNL Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service architecture including asset microservices. Key use cases include ingestion at scale with monitoring, reporting, and scheduling, while allowing for initial transfer of assets to cloud data stores using common cloud upload tooling. See [asset bulk ingestor tool](/help/assets/add-assets.md#asset-bulk-ingestor).

  This tool is for system administrator, consultant, or implementation partner personas. This feature allows for large scale ingestion and is ideally used during initial ingestion or occasional large ingestion. For smaller ingestion jobs, use the [[!DNL Experience Manager] desktop app](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-desktop-app/using/introduction.html?lang=en) or [upload using Assets user interface](/help/assets/add-assets.md#upload-assets).

  ![Configuration of bulk importer](/help/assets/assets/bulk-import-config-low-res.png)

* Users can now sort the digital assets in Card and Column views.

  ![sort assets](/help/assets/assets/asset-sort-options.png)

* The following enhancements are done for accessibility in [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] in this release. For more information, see [accessibility features in [!DNL Assets]](/help/assets/accessibility.md).

  * When navigating timeline using a keyboard, the Esc key can collapse the Show All option without losing the focus.
  * When navigating using keyboard tab key, after removing the last tag from the added tags, the tag field retains the focus.
  * [!DNL Experience Manager] components now contain appropriate information for name, role, and value to be used by screen readers.
  * After you delete the Type/Size combo box, Link combo box, Language combo box, or Text edit box, the keyboard focus returns to the next or the previous user interface elements or to a more relevant user interface element.
  * When hovering pointer over options, tips such as Select and Download appear. Users who use a screen magnifier may not see the file thumbnails because of these tips. Now, it is possible to preserve the focus, after removing the option using `Escape` key.
  * Upon selecting a grid cell from the grid present in the page, the focus shifts to the action bar that appears on the screen.
  * Visual users can differentiate between normal text and a link, as visual clues (underline and chevron icon) are displayed for links to all solutions in [!DNL Experience Manager] home page.

* **Batch Set Presets in Dynamic Media**: Now you can automate the creation and organization of multiple assets in an image set or spin set at the time you upload asset files to a folder either individually or using bulk ingestion.

  See [About Batch Set Presets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/batch-set-presets-dm.md).

* The following accessibility enhancements are now available in [!DNL Dynamic Media]:

  * Screen readers (JAWS, Narrator) narrate the name, role, and state for the menu items in the Embed size menu option.
  * Users can navigate the Email link dialog using the `Tab` key.
  * The workflow to create video encoding profiles is more user-friendly given the screen reader enhancement.
  * When navigating using `Tab` key, the focus moves to the appropriate user interface elements in the workflow to create an interactive video.
  * The Publish page, Edit Asset page, Edit Smart Crops page, and Image Set Editor page are improved to comply with web standards. Assistive technology (AT) users can now navigate these pages easily and take actions such as cropping images.
  * Viewers are improved to let users navigate using a keyboard.
  * The keyboard and screen reader users can use the crop functionality.
  * The keyboard users can better manage the hotspots.
