**Accessibility enhancements**

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] is now more accessible in compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) v2.1 guidelines. The accessibility has improved for the following use cases or interfaces:

The user interface elements are screen reader friendly, are accessible using a keyboard, and have better contrast. The following is a detailed list of enhancements:

* The [!UICONTROL Options], [!UICONTROL Scope], and [!UICONTROL Workflows] progress bars on [!UICONTROL Manage Publication] page are not read out by the screen-reader as progress bar. Instead, screen reader users perceive these status indicators as a tab list. (CQ-4273015)

* When adding tags in [!UICONTROL Properties] page of an asset, users navigate a tree structure of tags. The tree structure is not accessible as screen reader users do not hear anything when navigating it. (CQ-4272964)

* In the link sharing dialog, when navigating in browse mode, the screen reader,

  * Narrates the table information immediately when the dialog is loaded.
  * Is unable to navigate to all the listed auto-suggestions.
  * Does not narrate the displayed auto-suggestions for the [!UICONTROL Add Email Address/Search] combo box. (CQ-4294232)

* The [!UICONTROL Metadata Schema Editor] page and its elements are now accessible using a keyboard and are screen reader friendly. (CQ-4272953) Users can drag the components using the keyboard in NVDA browse mode. (CQ-4296326)

* On Assets user interface, the view settings are not accessible by keyboard. (CQ-4289038)

* The luminosity ratio is less than 3:1 for the Yellow-colored rating icons. It is not useful to users with limited vision and without perception of color. The rating stars are displayed in the  tab in asset  or in card view  

* Color and contrast of some user interface elements are updated so that users with limited vision or users without perception of color can distinguish these user interface elements. For example, the color of star rating icons in the [!UICONTROL Rating] section of [!UICONTROL Advanced] tab in the [!UICONTROL Properties] of an asset and in card view is changed for appropriate contrast. (CQ-4295106)

* The screen readers can now read the entries of the list box pop-up menu of combo box (in various fields on different pages) as a list of options. (CQ-4294017)

* To apply a workflow to an asset, the chevron arrow in the [!UICONTROL Timeline] can be accessed using a keyboard. (CQ-4289268)

* Users can remove selected tags in the [!UICONTROL Tags] field in [!UICONTROL Basic] tab of an asset's [!UICONTROL Properties] page using `x` symbol. The screen readers now announce the purpose and the number of selected tags (CQ-4273033).

* The read-only form fields can be focused upon using a keyboard. For example, the disabled fields on [!UICONTROL Basic] tab on an asset's [!UICONTROL Properties] page. (CQ-4273031)

* Access the options to filter assets in the left sidebar using a keyboard now. (CQ-4273018)

* The screen reader announces the purpose of various combo box elements such as Path field and the option to open Selection dialog in [!UICONTROL Basic] tab of an asset's [!UICONTROL Properties] page. (CQ-4273016)

* The volume controls for videos are accessible using a keyboard. (CQ-4272696)

* Many actionable options on the Assets user interface do not indicate focus when using keyboard. (CQ-4272694)

* Screen reader users now get to know when the rows in list view are selectable using a keyboard. The information is announced when pointer is hovered on the rows. (CQ-4271824)

* Some form fields, such as the user name and password fields on the login page, rely on placeholder values to give an accessible label. (CQ-4271716)

* Interactive user interface elements, such as links and options such as on header and zoom options of assets page or folder navigation can now be accessed using a keyboard. (CQ-4271412)

* Titles of all the browsed pages on [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] Assets are now unique. (CQ-4271409)

**Other enhancements**

The release provides the following other enhancements:

* Ability to reprocess assets with asset processing profiles, giving users full control of the process (run full asset processing, just apply specific processing profile, and decide if post-processing workflow should be run).
* Search queries return results faster now when the underlying cluster instance has been restarted behind the scenes (the initial search run could last longer in such a case before).
* Sort by 'Name' when viewing assets in list view in Assets interface and in the search results. See [search assets](/help/assets/search-assets.md#sort).
* Sort on ‘Created’ (Date) when viewing assets in list view in Assets interface and in the search results. See [search assets](/help/assets/search-assets.md#sort).
