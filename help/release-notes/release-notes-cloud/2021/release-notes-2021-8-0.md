The Release Date for Cloud Manager in AEM as a Cloud Service 2021.8.0 is August 12, 2021.
The next release is planned for September 09, 2021.

### What's New {#what-is-new-aug}

* Cloud Service customers can now view Service Level Agreement (SLA) reports in Cloud Manager. This will be made available progressively over the next few months.
   See [SLA Reporting](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/using-cloud-manager/sla-reporting.html) to learn more.

* The type and severity of the IndexType and `IndexDamAssetLucene` quality rules has been changed. These are now both Bugs of Blocker *serverity*.

* Increase max SSL certs per program to 50.

* Self-service capability to allow users to create and manage multiple repositories via Cloud Manager UI.

* SonarQube was unnecessarily reading Git history data. On large code bases, this could lead to an unnecessary build performance penalty.

* There is now an API available to invalidate the Maven dependency cache per pipeline.
 
* The version of the AEM Project Archetype used by Cloud Manager has been updated to version 29. 

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-aug}

* Update Available status should not be displayed when the latest release is less than the current release.

* Initial onboarding was failing for new organizations with very long names.

* Occasionally, when a pipeline is triggered twice for some reason, it results in one of the executions failing with *cannot update pipeline execution status* error. 

## Content Transfer Tool {#content-transfer-tool}

### Release Date {#release-date-ctt-latest}

The Release Date for Content Transfer Tool v1.5.6 is August 11, 2021.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-ctt}

* In some cases not all users were migrated to the target instance. To get this fix CTT v1.5.6 is required along with aem-ethos-tools 1.2.354 or later version on the target AEM as a Cloud Service instance.

* The **Stop Ingestion** button was being disabled during ingestion to the Publish instance. This is not necessary because there is no mongo restore step during Publish ingestion. 

* CTT did not clean up the `/tmp` directory after a successful extraction. This sometimes led to disk space issues.
