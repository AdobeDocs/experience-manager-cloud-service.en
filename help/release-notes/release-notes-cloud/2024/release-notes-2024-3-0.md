For more information, see the [documentation](/help/edge/overview.md) and watch the [AEM Gems - Getting started with AEM Authoring and Edge Delivery Services](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-experience-manager/aem-gems-getting-started-with-aem-authoring-and-edge-delivery/m-p/652694#M43905)

**Universal Editor for Headless Implementations**

The Universal Editor enables also decoupled web applications to harness the same intuitive in-context WYSIWYG authoring previously exclusive to traditional sites. Content creators can now visually compose layouts using Content Fragments with the same ease as components within pages.

What sets the Universal Editor apart is its adaptability to diverse web architectures, accommodating both server- and client-side rendering, remaining framework-agnostic, and eliminating the necessity for AEM hosting. Integrating existing web applications with the Universal Editor for content editing is straightforward, primarily requiring developers to incorporate specific data attributes into their markup.

With that, the Universal Editor ensures a consistent editing experience, regardless of content structure or underlying technology stack. For more information, see the [Universal Editor Introduction](/help/implementing/universal-editor/introduction.md).

**Content Management OpenAPIs for Content Fragments and Models**

### Early Adopter Program {#forms-early-adopter}

* **[Submit an Adaptive Form to Adobe Workfront Fusion Scenario](/help/forms/submit-adaptive-form-to-workfront-fusion.md)**: Forms as a Cloud Service offers an out-of-the-box option to effortlessly connect an Adaptive Form with Adobe Workfront. This simplifies the process of submitting an Adaptive Form to an Adobe Workfront scenario, allowing you trigger a Workfront Fusion scenario on submission of an Adaptive Form. 

    <br/> ![Adobe Workfront](/help/forms/assets/adobe-workfront.png) <br/> Using the Adobe Workfront Fusion Connector, you can design workflows that are triggered automatically upon submission of an Adaptive Form. For instance, envision a scenario where a workflow is initiated to assign a specific individual the task of reviewing submitted data, allowing approval or rejection of an application based on the information captured through the adaptive form. This streamlined integration enhances efficiency and brings a new level of automation to your workflow processes.| 

* **Reader Extension Service**: AEM Forms Communication APIs has brought Reader Extension Service to allow you to add functionalities like form filling and commenting to regular PDFs, making them interactive for users with the free Adobe Reader. 

* [Right to left languages support](/help/forms/supporting-new-language-localization-core-components.md): Adaptive Forms built on Core Components can now be presented in a Right-to-Left (RTL) language like Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. The RTL languages are spoken by over 2 billion people globally. Using a form in RTL language allows you to extend the reach of your adaptive forms to cater to these diverse audiences and select into RTL markets. In certain regions, it's also a legal mandate to provide forms in the local language. By accommodating local languages, you not only open doors to a broader audience but also ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

* **[Protect your documents with DocAssurance APIs (Part of Communication APIs)](/help/forms/aem-forms-cloud-service-communications-introduction.md#document-assurance-doc-assurance)**: The DocAssurance APIs empower you to safeguard sensitive information by signing and encrypting the documents. Through encryption, the contents of a document are transformed into an unreadable format, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access. This fortified layer of protection not only shields valuable data from unauthorized eyes but also provides peace of mind. The Signature APIs let your organization protect the security and privacy of Adobe PDF documents that it distributes and receives. This service uses digital signatures and certification to ensure that only intended recipients can alter documents. 

     You can write to `aem-forms-ea@adobe.com` from your official email id to join the early adopter program and request access to the capability.

* **[You can leverage the Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/content-requests.md#real-user-monitoring-for-aem-as-a-cloud-service)** to enable client-side collection for AEM as a Cloud Service.
Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service offers a more precise reflection of user interactions, ensuring a reliable measure of website engagement. It is a great opportunity to gain advanced insights into your page performance. While this is beneficial for customers who use either Adobe-managed CDN or non-Adobe-managed CDN. Additionally, for customers using a non-Adobe managed CDN, automated traffic reporting can now be enabled for them, thus removing the need to share any traffic report with Adobe.

   If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, please send an email to `aemcs-rum-adopter@adobe.com`, along with your domain name for each of the environments that you would like to enable RUM for from your email address associated with your Adobe ID. Adobe's product team will then enable the Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service for you.

### Early Adopter Programs {#foundation-early-adopter}

#### Traffic Filter Rules Alerts (Early Adopter Program) {#traffic-filter-rules-alerts-early-adopter}

The recently released [Traffic Filter Rules](/help/security/traffic-filter-rules-including-waf.md), which include the optionally licensable Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules, lets you configure what traffic should be allowed or denied. 

Now you can email **<aemcs-cdn-config-adopter@adobe.com>** to join the early adopter program so you can be alerted whenever your traffic filter rules are triggered. Actions Center email notifications will keep you informed when certain traffic conditions occur so you can take appropriate measures. 

#### CDN Configuration (Early Adopter Program) {#cdn-config-early-adopter}

In addition to the recently released [Traffic Filter Rules](/help/security/traffic-filter-rules-including-waf.md), which include the optionally licensable Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules, there's an opportunity to use the Configuration Pipeline to declare and deploy other types of CDN configuration. [Learn more](/help/implementing/dispatcher/cdn-configuring-traffic.md) and join the early adopter program by emailing **<aemcs-cdn-config-adopter@adobe.com>** to gain access to:

* 301/302 client-side redirects
* proxying requests at the edge to arbitrary origins (such as non-AEM applications)
* URL transformations
* setting or modifying request or response headers
* custom error pages when the CDN can't reach AEM

#### Apache/Dispatcher Runtime Ingestion of Rewrite Maps (Early Adopter Program) {#apache-rewritemaps-early-adopter}

Similar to AEM 6.5, Apache/dispatcher will ingest rewrite maps placed in a specific location in the publish repository, and load them, without requiring a web tier pipeline execution. This opens up opportunities for a business user to declare redirects using a UI, such as that offered by ACS Commons Redirect Map Manager. Please reach out to **<aemcs-cdn-config-adopter@adobe.com>** for more information.

#### Edge Side Includes (ESI) for Loading Dynamic Content (Early Adopter Program) {#esi-early-adopter}

The Adobe Managed CDN now supports Edge Side Includes (ESI), a markup language for edge level dynamic web content assembly. By including ESI snippets, you can cache the overall HTML page at the CDN with higher TTLs, while more frequently fetching from origin those smaller sections that require higher cadence updates (lower TTLs). Please reach out to **<aemcs-cdn-config-adopter@adobe.com>** for more information.

#### RDE Support for Front-End Code using Site Themes and Site Templates (Early Adopter Program) {#rde-frontend-early-adopter}

[Rapid Development Environments (RDEs)](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/rapid-development-environments.md) now support front-end code based on [site themes](/help/sites-cloud/administering/site-creation/site-themes.md) and [site templates](/help/sites-cloud/administering/site-creation/site-templates.md), for early adopters. With RDEs, this is done using a command line directive, rather than a [front-end pipeline](/help/sites-cloud/administering/site-creation/enable-front-end-pipeline.md). Please reach out to **<aemcs-rde-support@adobe.com>** to try it out and provide feedback.

#### Enhanced logging for RDEs (Early Adopter Program) {#rde-logging-early-adopter}

While debugging code in a [Rapid Development Environment (RDE)](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/rapid-development-environments.md), developers can now configure and stream logs more efficiently, using the command line, and without modifying OSGI properties in version control. Features include:

* declare log levels on a per package or class level
* customize the log output format
* stream multiple logs in parallel 

Please reach out to **<aemcs-rde-support@adobe.com>** to try it out and provide feedback.
