## [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] {#assets}

### Early access feature in Dynamic Media {#dm-early-access}

**AI-generated video captions** 

AI-generated video captions in Adobe Dynamic Media use artificial intelligence to generate captions automatically for video content. This feature is designed to improve accessibility and enhance the user experience by providing accurate, real-time captions. The AI analyzes the video's audio track to transcribe speech and create captions, which can be edited for accuracy or customization. These captions help meet accessibility requirements and improve video engagement for audiences who rely on or prefer text-based video support. 

To get early access to AI-generated captions support on your Dynamic Media account, [create and submit an Adobe Customer Support case](/help/assets/dynamic-media/video.md##enable-dash).  

### New features in Assets view {#assets-view-new-features}

**Scheduled Reports**

Reports can now be automatically generated in the Assets View on a recurring schedule or at a future date, reducing the effort to uncover data-driven insights.

### New features in Content Hub {#content-hub-new-features}

**Digital Rights management for licensed assets**

Organizations can now increase license compliance and minimize risk of sharing assets with licensing terms by leveraging DRM for licensed assets for users of Content Hub, requiring users to review and accept license terms before they can start downloading licensed assets. For more information, see [Manage licensed assets on Content Hub](/help/assets/manage-licensed-assets-on-content-hub.md).

![download-multiple-license](/help/assets/assets/download-multiple-license.png)

**Asset card metadata configuration**

Content Hub now allows you to configure the key metadata fields that you need to display on the Asset Card upto a maximum of 6 fields. For more information, see the Asset Card section in [Configure Content Hub](/help/assets/configure-content-hub-ui-options.md#asset-card).

![key metadata on Asset Card](/help/assets/assets/asset-card-key-metadata.png)

**Configure the visibility and download of expired assets**

Administrators can now control if they need expired assets to be visible on Content Hub. If the expired assets are made visible, they can also define if users can download them. For more information, see the Expired Assets section in [Configure Content Hub](/help/assets/configure-content-hub-ui-options.md#expired-assets-content-hub).

## [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] {#forms}

### New feature in AEM Forms {#forms-new-features}

* [Enhance User Experience with Navigation Buttons in Panel Layouts](/help/forms/rule-editor-core-components-usecases.md#navigating-among-panels-using-button): You can now add navigation buttons to your panel layouts, such as Horizontal Tabs, Vertical Tabs, Accordions, or Wizard. These buttons enhance the user experience by simplifying transitions between panels, focusing on the selected panel.

<!--* **Specify Display Styles for Document of Record (DoR) Components**: In an XFA file, you can now specify the display styles for Document of Record components. These styles can later be applied to the corresponding components in Adaptive Forms Editor.-->

### New Pre-release features in AEM Forms {#forms-new-prerelease-features}

* [Auto-save a draft for Core Components based Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/save-core-component-based-form-as-draft.md): Users can now benefit from an auto-save feature that saves a partially completed form as a draft automatically. They can return later to finish filling it out on the same or other device. This feature improves conversion rates for organizations by reducing form abandonment, as users do not need to start over form filling from the beginning.

* [Update Adobe Sign scopes easily](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/integrate/services/adobe-sign-integration-adaptive-forms): You can modify the scopes of an Adobe Sign configuration directly from the AEM Cloud Configurations page, making it quicker and easier to update existing configurations.

* [Asynchronous function support for Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/using-async-funct-in-rule-editor.md): When your Adaptive Form requires asynchronous operations, such as waiting for external processes or data retrieval, you can implement these operations with custom functions and configure them in the Rule Editor.

## [!DNL Experience Manager] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] Foundation {#foundation}

### Configuration to Control Form Submissions {#configuration-submissions}

To control form submissions for Coral or Foundation forms at specific locations, AEM has introduced a new configuration: `com.adobe.granite.ui.components.FormRestrict`. This configuration consists of two fields:

1. **Add Allowed Paths**: Specifies the paths where form actions are permitted.
1. **Restrict Behavior**: Determines the behavior for restricted paths (paths not included in the allowed list). You can choose between two options:
   * **Popup** (default): Displays a popup notification.
   * **Prevent**:Blocks form submission.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This configuration is not supported for all Coral or Foundation forms located under `/apps`, `/libs`, `/mnt/overlay`, and `/mnt/override`.

### Self-Serve Log Forwarding with Advanced Networking Option {#log-forwarding}

While AEM (including Apache/Dispatcher) and CDN logs can be downloaded from Cloud Manager, many organizations find it beneficial to stream those logs to a preferred logging destination. AEM now supports [log forwarding](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/log-forwarding.md) to Azure Blob Storage, Datadog, HTTPS, Elasticsearch (and OpenSearch), and Splunk. AEM logs can be optionally forwarded over advanced networking configurations, such as using a dedicated IP address.

This feature is configured by users in a self-serve manner, and deployed using the [Config Pipeline](/help/operations/config-pipeline.md).

### Pipeline-free URL Redirects for Business Users {#pipeline-free-redirects}

Browser-side redirects are useful when a web page has been taken down or has moved, or other scenarios. With [Pipeline-free URL Redirects](/help/implementing/dispatcher/pipeline-free-url-redirects.md), you can place an Apache rewrite map file in an AEM publish location, where it is automatically loaded -- no need to commit the file to source control or initiate a Cloud Manager pipeline.

Options for publishing the rewrite file include uploading it as an asset, using the ACS Commons Rewrite Map Manager, or interacting with a custom user interface.

### Config Pipeline for RDEs {#config-pipeline-rdes}

Rapid Development Environments are a powerful tool for quickly deploying and testing code and configuration in a Cloud environment. RDEs now support [syncing of configuration YAML-files](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/rapid-development-environments.md#deploy-config-pipeline), including CDN settings such as traffic filter rules and request/response transformations, as well as log forwarding and other configuration options. [See the full list](/help/operations/config-pipeline.md) of supported configuration options for more details.

### New Product Profiles {#new-product-profiles}

When a new AEM environment is created, Product Profiles automatically appear in the Adobe Admin Console, enabling administrators to assign access to licensed solutions and features. 

New environments now include an updated set of Product Profiles, making them compatible with future features including generating API credentials in the Adobe Developer Console. Existing environments will be able to update their Product Profiles in a future release. [Learn more](/help/onboarding/aem-cs-team-product-profiles.md).

### New AEM Developer Console (Public Beta) {#aem-developer-console-beta}

Try out a revamped [AEM Developer Console](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/aem-developer-console.md), which offers a more interactive experience for debugging code in Cloud environments.

Anyone can access the public beta by clicking the *New Console Available* button in the current AEM Developer Console. Adobe welcomes feedback, which you can email to **<aemcs-new-devconsole-ui-beta@adobe.com>**.
