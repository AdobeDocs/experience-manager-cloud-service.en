### New features in [!DNL Assets] {#assets-features}

**New Assets view in [!DNL Experience Manager Assets]**

The new Assets view is now available in Experience Manager Assets. Assets View provides simplified user interface, which makes it easy to manage, discover, and distribute your digital assets. The experience is targeted to creatives, read-only asset consumers, and lighter-weight DAM users.

**Search experience enhancements**

Experience Manager Assets now empowers you to do more from the search results user interface: You can now:

  * Perform search within the current repository location by default instead of searching for the keyword in the entire repository.

  * Navigate to the folder location for assets that display in the search results.

**Thumbnail previews for 3D assets**

[!DNL Experience Manager Assets] now generates thumbnail previews for common 3D file formats including gLB, USDz, FBX, 3DS, OBJ, and SBSAR. When these files are uploaded, thumbnails are automatically generated by default.

**Link share configuration**

A new improved user experience for creating link shares along with a brand new set of configurations that let administrators customize the default behavior of this capability for your users.

### New features in Assets view {#assets-view-features}

**Hierarchical tagging of assets for faster search experience**

Flat lists of controlled vocabularies become unmanageable over time. Assets view now supports hierarchical tagging structure, which facilitates applying relevant metadata, categorizing assets, supporting search, reusing tags, improving discoverability, and so on.

**Pin files, folders, and collections for quick access**

You can now pin files, folders, and collections for faster access to these items when you need them later. The pinned items display in the **Quick access** section of My Workspace. You can access them using My Workspace instead of navigating to the location where they are saved within the repository.

Assets view now enables you to filter assets available in the Trash folder. You can apply standard or custom filters to search appropriate assets within the Trash folder to either restore or permanently delete them.

**Thumbnail previews for 3D assets**

Assets view now generates thumbnail previews for common 3D file formats including gLB, USDz, FBX, 3DS, OBJ, and SBSAR. When these files are uploaded to Assets view, thumbnails are automatically generated by the system, by default.
