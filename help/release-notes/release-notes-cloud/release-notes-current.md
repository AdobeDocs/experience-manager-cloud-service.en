## [!DNL Experience Manager as a Cloud Service] Foundation {#foundation}

### What is New {#what-is-new-foundation}

* [Rapid Development Environments](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/rapid-development-environments.md) - RDEs enable developers to rapidly troubleshoot issues and deploy new features on AEM as a Cloud Service.  

  Rapid Development Environments are a new type of Cloud Environment intended as a fast, consistent, and extensible way of validating that code working locally also functions as expected in the Cloud. Using Command Line Tools, quickly "sync" content packages, bundles, content files, OSGI configuration, or dispatcher configuration to the RDE. See this in action in the video below:  
  
  >[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3413508/?quality=12&learn=on)   
 
  After successfully validating code in the RDE, it is encouraged to deploy to a Cloud Dev Environment to exercise the Cloud Manager quality gates, before deploying via production pipeline to stage and production environments.  

  Each program includes one RDE and optionally, more can be licensed.  
    
  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >RDEs will be gradually rolled out over the next few weeks; you can send an email to aemcs-rde-support@adobe.com to skip to the front of the line.
