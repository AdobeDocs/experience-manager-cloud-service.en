## [!DNL Experience Manager] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] Foundation {#foundation}

### Edge Side Includes (ESI) for Loading Dynamic Content {#esi}

The Adobe Managed CDN now supports [Edge Side Includes (ESI)](/help/implementing/dispatcher/edge-side-includes.md), a markup language for edge level dynamic web content assembly. By including ESI snippets, you can cache the overall HTML page at the CDN with higher TTLs, while more frequently fetching from origin those smaller sections that require higher cadence updates (lower TTLs). This feature will be rolled out gradually.

### Basic Authentication at the CDN {#basicauth-cdn}

Protect certain content resources by popping up a basic auth dialog requiring a username and password. This feature primarily targets light authentication use cases, like business stakeholders reviewing content, rather than serving as a comprehensive solution for end-user access rights. The list of username and passwords in managed through a configuration file in git that is deployed via Configuration Pipeline, with a reference to secret-type Cloud Manager environment variables. [Learn more](/help/implementing/dispatcher/cdn-credentials-authentication.md#basic-auth).

### Client-Side Redirects {#client-side-redirects}

Configure 301/302 client-side redirects in source control, and deploy to the CDN. [Learn more](/help/implementing/dispatcher/cdn-configuring-traffic.md#client-side-redirectors).<!-- and join the early adopter program by emailing **<aemcs-cdn-config-adopter@adobe.com>**. --> Note that there are several other features already available related to [CDN configuration](/help/implementing/dispatcher/cdn-configuring-traffic.md), including request and response transformations, and routing traffic to off-AEM sites.

<!-- Content Delivery-related Early Adopter Programs {#foundation-early-adopter} Email **<aemcs-cdn-config-adopter@adobe.com>**, indicating which of the early adopter programs below you are interested in. -->

### New AEM Developer Console (Public Beta) {#aem-developer-console-beta}
[hello](/implementing/developing/introduction/aem-developer-console.md)


### Business Users Can Declare Redirects Outside of Git (Early Adopter Program) {#apache-rewritemaps-early-adopter}

Similar to AEM 6.5, Apache/dispatcher ingest rewrite maps placed in a specific location in the publish repository, and load them, without requiring a web tier pipeline execution. This approach let business users declare redirects using a spreadsheet or a UI, like ACS Commons Redirect Map Manager or a custom application. Join the early adopter program by emailing **<aemcs-cdn-config-adopter@adobe.com>**.
