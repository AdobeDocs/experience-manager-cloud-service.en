* **[Update Adobe Sign scopes easily](/help/forms/adobe-sign-integration-adaptive-forms.md)**: You can modify the scopes of an Adobe Sign configuration directly from the AEM Cloud Configurations page, making it quicker and easier to update existing configurations.

* **[Asynchronous function support for Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/using-async-funct-in-rule-editor.md)**: When your Adaptive Form requires asynchronous operations, such as waiting for external processes or data retrieval, you can implement these operations with custom functions and configure them in the Rule Editor.

### Pre-release features in AEM Forms {#forms-new-prerelease-features}

* **Manage Publication**: You can use the Manage Publication workflow to publish or unpublish forms across environments, typically from the author instance to the publish and preview instance(s). It allows users to publish, unpublish, or schedule the publication of content in a streamlined manner.

* **[Auto-save a draft for Core Components based Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/save-core-component-based-form-as-draft.md)**: Users can now benefit from an auto-save feature that saves a partially completed form as a draft automatically. They can return later to finish filling it out on the same or other device. This feature improves conversion rates for organizations by reducing form abandonment, as users do not need to start over form filling from the beginning.

* **[Rule editor enhancements](/help/forms/invoke-service-enhancements-rule-editor.md)**: For Adaptive Forms based on Core Components, you can now populate dropdown options using the output of Invoke Service, set repeatable panels using the output of Invoke Service, set individual panels using the output of Invoke Service and use the output parameter of Invoke Service to validate other fields. 

* **[Enhance User Experience with Navigation Buttons in Panel Layouts](/help/forms/rule-editor-core-components-usecases.md#navigating-among-panels-using-button)**: You can now add navigation buttons to your panel layouts, such as Horizontal Tabs, Vertical Tabs, Accordions, or Wizard. These buttons enhance the user experience by simplifying transitions between panels, focusing on the selected panel.

This capability enables the rendering of XFA form templates in HTML5 format, making forms accessible on devices that do not support XFA-based PDF forms.

   ![HTML Forms (XFA-based Web Forms)](/help/forms/assets/html-forms-xfa-based-web-forms.png) 


* **[Integrate Adaptive Forms with Adobe Marketo Engage](/help/forms/integrate-form-to-marketo-engage.md)**: AEM Forms as a Cloud Service now includes an easy-to-use option to connect Adaptive Forms with Adobe Marketo Engage. This integration allows you to create Adaptive Forms directly with Marketo Engage's lead capture and related custom objects. You can now prefill form fields with data from Marketo Engage and submit data back to automate workflows like smart campaigns and email automation. You can also connect an Adaptive Form with the Munchkin library to track the number of visits, clicks, and form submissions.


#### Interactive Communications and Communication APIs

* **Interactive Communication Editor**: The Interactive Communication Editor is a user-friendly, graphical Communication design tool that simplifies the creation of personalized, data-driven correspondences and runs in any modern browser.

* **[Signature API (Document Assurance)](/help/forms/aem-forms-cloud-service-communications-introduction.md#document-assurance)**: A new RESTful API in Communication APIs enables easy management of PDF signatures. It supports operations like:
    * Clear Signature: Removes a signature from a specified field.
    * Remove Signature Field: Deletes a specified signature field.




<!-- 
* **Hamburger Menu Layout in Adaptive Forms**: Adaptive Forms now offers a responsive hamburger menu layout for mobile devices. This collapsible menu organizes form sections, making navigation more 
intuitive and improving the mobile form-filling experience.

* **Masked Field with Eye Icon (Password Box Component)**: The Password Box is a text input field that masks the characters typed into it by displaying placeholder symbols. It allows users to securely input sensitive information, such as passwords and enables them to toggle visibility on demand using the eye icon.

### Improved Tree Replication Performance (and deprecation of Publish Content Tree Workflow) {#tree-replication-performance}

[Tree Activation Workflow Step](/help/operations/replication.md#tree-activation) is a new workflow model step recommended for replicating deep content hierarchies. Of note, it allows independent replications (e.g., through quick publish or manage publication) to proceed in parallel with the in-progress tree replication workflow. This is particularly useful if you need to publish some time-sensitive content while a bulk replication is still in-progress. Tree Replication Step replaces Publish Content Tree Workflow and its related Workflow Step, which are now deprecated. 

### OpenAPI-based APIs - Early Adopter Program {#open-apis-earlyadopter}

Developers can deeply integrate AEM as Cloud Service features into their own applications and tools. New AEM as a Cloud Service APIs will follow the OpenAPI specification, with a goal of being consistent, well-documented, and user-friendly. Credentials for endpoints requiring authentication will be generated by creating Adobe Developer Console projects.

Learn more about OpenAPI-based AEM APIs and try out an end-to-end tutorial illustrating configuration and usage.

Concretely, the API endpoints listed below are available as part of an early adopter program. If interested, email [aem-apis@adobe.com](mailto:aem-apis@adobe.com) describing how you intend to make use of them.
