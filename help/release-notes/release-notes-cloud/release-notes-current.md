### Traffic Filter Rules, including WAF {#traffic-filter-rules-waf}

[Filter traffic at the Adobe Managed CDN](/help/security/traffic-filter-rules-including-waf.md) by declaring rules matching website traffic by properties including url, IP address, and user agent -- or set custom traffic rate limits to guard against DoS attacks. Customers may also license a set of advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules for extra protection against sophisticated website threats. 

We encourage you to get familar with traffic filter rules by [trying out a tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/security/traffic-filter-and-waf-rules/overview.html)! It walks you through setting up a new Cloud Manager Configuration Pipeline, declaring rules in a configuration file, and analyzing CDN logs for malicious traffic.

Traffic filter rules are available now on dev environments, with a gradual rollout to stage and prod environments in November. You may request earlier access on stage and prod by emailing **aemcs-waf-adopter@adobe.com**. 

The advanced WAF traffic filter rules can be licensed later this year through the Enhanced Security or WAF-DDoS Protection offerings.
