## [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] {#forms}

### What is new in [!DNL Forms] {#what-is-new-forms}

* **Communications - Document Manipulation APIs support in Forms as a Cloud Service SDK**: [Document Manipulation APIs](/help/forms/aem-forms-cloud-service-communications.md) help to combine, rearrange, and validate PDF documents. You can now use Communications - Document Generation APIs on a local development environment with the help of AEM Forms as a Cloud Service SDK.

* **Use custom XCI for generating a Document of Record**: You can now [use a custom XCI file to set various properties of a Document of Record](/help/forms/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.md#use-a-custom-xci-file). It overrides the master XCI with the custom changes. It provides more control over the generation of Documents of Record, increasing personalization, and customization opportunities.

* **Use invisible CAPTCHA in an adaptive form**: You can use the [invisible CAPTCHA to show the CAPTCHA challenge only in the case of a suspicious activity](/help/forms/captcha-adaptive-forms.md). If no suspicious activity is found the CAPTCHA challenge is not displayed. It helps assess human form completion without checkbox requirements, reduce customization efforts, and improve the end-user experience.

* **Form Data Model Configurations**: You can now [reuse Form Data Model configurations across environments](/help/forms/create-form-data-models.md#runmode-specific-context-aware-config), simplifying data integrations and reducing IT costs.

## [!DNL Experience Manager] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] Foundation {#foundation}

### SDK Build Analyzers {#sdk-build-analyzers}

The AEM as a Cloud Service SDK Build Analyzer Maven Plugin detects problems in a maven project, including missing dependencies. It gives developers an opportunity to discover issues during local development, well before deploying to Cloud environments with Cloud Manager. 

A new analyzer has been recently added:

* `content-packages-validation` - validates for well formed content syntax and structure for packages that will be installed during deployment

It is strongly recommended to update your maven project with the latest version of the analyzer or include the analyzer if you haven't yet done so. For more information, see the documentation [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/build-analyzer-maven-plugin.html).

## Cloud Manager {#cloud-manager}

You can find a complete list of Cloud Manager monthly releases [here](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/release-notes-cloud-manager/release-notes-cm-current.md).

## Content Transfer Tool {#ctt-release}

### Release Date {#release-date-ctt}

The Release Date for Content Transfer Tool v1.9.0 is February 28, 2022.

### What's New {#what-is-new-ctt}

* Check Size Guardrails - The Content Transfer Tool Check Size feature helps reduce failed content transfers.  With the Check Size feature, users can 1) determine whether they have sufficient disk space in the `crx-quickstart` subdirectory before extraction, and 2) estimate the migration set size and verify if itâ€™s supported. If one or both these checks are violated, users will see warnings in the CTT UI. With this guardrail, you can avoid content transfer failures and proactively discuss migration options with Adobe Customer Care. Refer to [Determining migration set size and disk space](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/migration-journey/cloud-migration/content-transfer-tool/getting-started-content-transfer-tool.html?lang=en#migration-set-size) for more details.

## Best Practices Analyzer {#bpa-release}

### Release Date {#release-date-bpa}

The Release Date for Best Practices Analyzer v2.1.28 is April 22, 2022.

### What's New {#what-is-new-bpa}

* Ability to detect and report on usage of unsupported Asset Manager APIs. There are four APIs that are no longer supported in AEM as a Cloud Service. Customers should ensure that they are no longer using these APIs and should be using the new method of asset upload.

* Ability to detect usage of Content Fragment templates. Content Fragment templates are no longer supported for new content fragment creation on AEM as a Cloud Service. Customers will need to create content fragment models to replace content fragment templates.

* Ability to detect assets with more than 100 descendants under the metadate node of the asset in the repository. It is recommended to remove metadata nodes that are not needed to improve the performance when loading folders consisting of such assets.

* Ability to detect and report on type of Data Store used.

* Pattern updated for AEM Form Portal.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-bpa}

* BPA was reporting findings for core components instead of reporting only on customer components. This has been fixed.
