![Tagging Management](/help/assets/assets/my-workspace.png)

**Search experience enhancements**

Experience Manager Assets now empowers you to do more from the search results user interface: You can now:

* [Perform search within the current repository location](/help/assets/search-assets.md) by default instead of searching for the keyword in the entire repository.

* [Navigate to the folder location](/help/assets/search-assets.md#aftersearch) for assets that display in the search results.

**Thumbnail previews for 3D assets**

[!DNL Experience Manager Assets] now generates [thumbnail previews for common 3D file formats](/help/assets/file-format-support.md) including gLB, USDz, FBX, 3DS, OBJ, and SBSAR. When these files are uploaded, thumbnails are automatically generated by default.

**Dynamic Media: Updated Smart Crop-related fields in Image profile**  

The user interface for some Smart Crop-related fields in an Image Profile are now updated to reflect the current guidelines for defining a Smart Crop.

### New features in Assets view {#assets-view-features}

**Hierarchical tagging of assets for faster search experience**

Flat lists of controlled vocabularies become unmanageable over time. Assets view now supports [hierarchical tagging structure](/help/assets/tagging-management-assets-view.md), which facilitates applying relevant metadata, categorizing assets, supporting search, reusing tags, improving discoverability, and so on.

![Tagging Management](/help/assets/assets/tags-hierarchy.png)

**Pin files, folders, and collections for quick access**

You can now [pin files, folders, and collections for faster access](/help/assets/my-workspace-assets-view.md) to these items when you need them later. The pinned items display in the **Quick access** section of My Workspace. You can access them using My Workspace instead of navigating to the location where they are saved within the repository.

![Tasks in Workspace](/help/assets/assets/quick-access.png)

**Filter assets in the Trash folder**

Assets view now enables you to [filter assets available in the Trash folder](/help/assets/navigate-assets-view.md). You can apply standard or custom filters to search appropriate assets within the Trash folder to either restore or permanently delete them.

**Thumbnail previews for 3D assets**

Assets view now generates thumbnail previews for common 3D file formats including gLB, USDz, FBX, 3DS, OBJ, and SBSAR. When these files are uploaded to Assets view, thumbnails are automatically generated by the system, by default.

![Tasks in Workspace](/help/assets/assets/3d-preview.png)

Assets view now supports [viewing top searched terms within your deployment](/help/assets/my-workspace-assets-view.md) using the **Insights** section of My Workspace. You can also navigate to detailed Insights to view top searches during the last 30 days or 12 months.

![Tasks in Workspace](/help/assets/assets/insights-top-searches.png)

## [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] {#forms}

### New features available in [!DNL Forms] {#new-features-available-in-channel}

* [Adaptive Forms within AEM Page Editor](/help/forms/create-or-add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page.md): You can now use AEM Page Editor to quickly create and add multiple forms to your sites pages. This capability allows content authors to create seamless data capture experiences within Sites pages using the power of adaptive forms components including dynamic behavior, validations, data integration, generate document of record and business process automation. You can: 

    * Create an Adaptive Form by dragging and dropping form components to Adaptive Forms Container Component in AEM Sites editor or Experience Fragments.  
    * Use the Adaptive Forms Wizard within AEM Sites editor so you can create forms independent of any Sites page, providing you the freedom to reuse such forms across multiple pages.
    * Add multiple forms to a Sites page, streamlining the user experience and providing greater flexibility.
   
        >[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3419284?quality=12&learn=on)

* [Adobe Acrobat Sign Solutions for Government](/help/forms/adobe-sign-integration-adaptive-forms.md): AEM Forms now integrate with Adobe Acrobat Sign Solutions for Government. This integration provides an advanced level of compliance and security for e-Signatures with Adaptive Form submissions for government associated accounts (Government departments and agencies).

    Integration with Adobe Acrobat Sign Solutions for Government enables Adobe's partners and government customers to use electronic signatures in Adaptive Forms for some of the most mission-critical and sensitive lines of business. This additional layer of security ensures that all e-signatures are fully compliant with FedRAMP Moderate compliance, providing Adobe's government customers with peace of mind.

* [Enhanced error handling with custom error handlers in rule editor](/help/forms/add-custom-error-handler-adaptive-forms.md): You can now invoke a custom function (using Client Library) in response to an error returned by an external service and provide a tailored response to end users. Or, you can take specific actions for errors returned by a service. For example, you can invoke a custom workflow in the backend for specific error codes or inform the customer that the service is down.

    This functionality helps improve your overall error-handling capability by introducing standards-based error responses that are backward compatible with OOTB error handlers, with greater flexibility and control.

* [Enhanced authentication methods for Form Data Model](/help/forms/configure-data-sources.md): Experience heightened security with the introduction of Client Credentials based authentication for connecting AEM Forms with compatible data sources. This enhancement eliminates the need for impersonation or user login, bolstering the protection of your data. 

* [Adaptive Forms with repeatable sections](/help/forms/create-forms-repeatable-sections.md): You can now make [Accordion](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/accordion.html), [Wizard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/wizard.html), [Panel](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/panel-container.html), and [Horizontal Tabs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/horizontal-tabs.html) components in a Core Components based Adaptive Form to create repeatable sections. 

    >[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3421052/adaptive-forms-repeatable-sections-repeat-sections/?quality=12&learn=on)

    These repeatable sections allow you to provide an unlimited number of entries without a fixed field count. It is useful when the required instances of data are unknown in advance. Forms users can easily add or remove sections, making forms adaptable to different data entry scenarios and simplifying collection of multiple occurrences of the same data.

* **[Submit Adaptive Forms to Microsoft&reg; SharePoint and Microsoft&reg; OneDrive](/help/forms/configuring-submit-actions.md)**: Improve business user agility so you can launch new forms quickly and store submitted data in everyday tools they use like Microsoft&reg; SharePoint site or OneDrive folder.

Use [Headless Adaptive Forms](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-headless-adaptive-forms/using/overview.html) to enable your developers to create, publish, and manage interactive forms that can be accessed and interacted with through APIs, rather than through a traditional graphical user interface. Headless adaptive forms help you:
