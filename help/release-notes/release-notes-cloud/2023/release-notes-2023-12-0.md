## [!DNL Experience Manager Sites] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] {#sites}

### Early Adopter Program {#sites-early-adopter}

**You can leverage the [Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/content-requests.md#real-user-monitoring-for-aem-as-a-cloud-service)** to enable client-side collection for AEM as a Cloud Service. 

Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service offers a more precise reflection of user interactions, ensuring a reliable measure of website engagement. It is a great opportunity to gain advanced insights into your page performance. While this is beneficial for customers who use either Adobe-managed CDN or non-Adobe-managed CDN. Additionally, for customers using a non-Adobe managed CDN, automated traffic reporting can now be enabled for them, thus removing the need to share any traffic report with Adobe.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, please send an email to `aemcs-rum-adopter@adobe.com`, along with your domain name for the production, stage and dev environment from your email address associated with your Adobe ID. Adobe's product team will then enable the Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service for you.

**Find Similar Images**

* **Smart tags blocklist**: Experience Manager Assets now enables you to define a list of blocked tags. These tags are automatically removed from the auto-generated smart tags when you upload assets to the repository. This capability performs tags governance and saves a lot of time as you can add a tag to the block list and AEM Assets automatically excludes it from the list of tags for any of the assets that are added to the repository.

**Video Preview**: AEM Assets now generates preview renditions of all supported video formats by default, without the need to configure a processing profile.

You can configure Microsoft SharePoint List as a datasource for a Form Data Model and use the **Submit using Form Data Model** submit action to connect an Adaptive Form with SharePoint List. 

<!-- 

* **Configure a shard for Adobe Sign for AEM Forms**: Adobe distributes Acrobat Sign API around the globe in many deployment units called "shards." Each shard serves a customer's account, such as NA1, NA2, NA3, EU1, JP1, AU1, IN1, and others. The shard names correspond to geographic locations. You can now use more than one shard while using Adobe Sign integration with AEM Forms.

This simplifies the process of submitting an Adaptive Form to an Adobe Workfront scenario, allowing you trigger a Workfront Fusion scenario on submission of an Adaptive Form.

The RTL languages are spoken by over 2 billion people globally. Using a form in RTL language allows you to extend the reach of your adaptive forms to cater to these diverse audiences and select into RTL markets. In certain regions, it's also a legal mandate to provide forms in the local language. By accommodating local languages, you not only open doors to a broader audience but also ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. 

  ![Right to left language support](/help/forms/assets/right-to-left-language-support.png)

* **[Protect your documents with DocAssurance APIs (Part of Communication APIs)](/help/forms/aem-forms-cloud-service-communications-introduction.md#document-assurance-doc-assurance)**: The DocAssurance APIs empower you to safeguard sensitive information by signing and encrypting the documents. Through encryption, the contents of a document are transformed into an unreadable format, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access. This fortified layer of protection not only shields valuable data from unauthorized eyes but also provides peace of mind. The Signature APIs let your organization protect the security and privacy of Adobe PDF documents that it distributes and receives. This service uses digital signatures and certification to ensure that only intended recipients can alter documents.
