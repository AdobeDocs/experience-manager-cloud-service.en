* AEM personalization activities can now leverage experience fragments in lieu of our legacy offers. This feature:
  * enables a migration path where AEM content would promote experience fragment offers rather than legacy library offers to provide appropriately styled content that align with the personalization at scale going forward.
  * prevents content authors from accidentally serving unstyled content on their site. 
  * allows targeting mode of any component to be converted to an experience fragment (both JSON and HTML types) which uses editable templates.

>[!NOTE]

>Existing personalization activities that are already using legacy offers can continue to do so but new personalization activities ought to be created as experience fragments since that is the recommended approach going forward.
