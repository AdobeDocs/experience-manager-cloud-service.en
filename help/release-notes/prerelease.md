# Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service Prerelease Channel {#prerelease-channel}

Learn how to use the prerelease channel to get a preview of upcoming features to AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service delivers new features on a monthly cadence, according to the [Experience Manager releases road map.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/update-releases-roadmap.html#aem-as-cloud-service)

In order to become familiar with the features scheduled to go live the following month, you can subscribe to the prerelease channel, which is accessible by configuring your development environments or any sandbox environments. You can preview changes accessible via the AEM UI as well as build code against any new prerelease APIs.

The list of prerelease features for a given month are posted within the [monthly release notes.](/help/release-notes/release-notes-cloud/release-notes-current.md)

## How to Enable the Prerelease {#enable-prerelease}

The prerelease features can be experienced in different ways:

* Cloud environments (standard program dev environments or any sandbox program environment type)
* Local SDK

### Cloud Environments {#cloud-environments}

To update a cloud environment to use the prerelease, you must add a new environment variable. You can do this either using the Cloud Manager UI or via CLI.

#### Add Environment Variable Using the UI {#add-with-ui}

1. Navigate to the **Program** &gt; **Environment** &gt; **Environment Configuration** you wish to update.

1. Add a new [environment variable:](../implementing/cloud-manager/environment-variables.md)

    | Name | Value | Service Applied | Type |
    |------|-------|-----------------|------|
    | `AEM_RELEASE_CHANNEL` | `prerelease` | All | Variable|

1. Save the changes and the environment will refresh with prerelease feature toggles enabled.

#### Add Environment Variable Using the CLI {#add-with-cli}

You can also use the Cloud Manager API and CLI to update the environment variables.

* Using [Cloud Manager API's environment variables endpoint,](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-cloud/cloud-manager/reference/api/#operation/patchEnvironmentVariables) set the `AEM_RELEASE_CHANNEL` environment variable to the value `prerelease`. 

    ```text
    PATCH /program/{programId}/environment/{environmentId}/variables
    [
            {
                    "name" : "AEM_RELEASE_CHANNEL",
                    "value" : "prerelease",
                    "type" : "string"
            }
    ]
    ```

* [The Cloud Manager CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-cloudmanager#aio-cloudmanagerset-environment-variables-environmentid) can also be used

    ```shell
    aio cloudmanager:environment:set-variables <ENVIRONMENT_ID> --programId=<PROGRAM_ID> --variable AEM_RELEASE_CHANNEL â€œprerelease
    ```

The variable can be deleted or set back to a different value if you want the environment to be restored to the behavior of the regular (non-prerelease) channel.

### Local SDK {#local-sdk}

You can see new features in the Sites console in the local Quickstart SDK and code against new APIs in the prerelease by configuring your Maven project to reference the prerelease `API Jar` located in Maven Central. You can also see these prerelease features in your local development environment by starting the regular Quickstart SDK in prerelease mode.

#### Start Quickstart SDK in Prerelease Mode {#prerelease-mode}

1. Download the SDK from the software distribution portal and install as described in [Accessing the AEM as a Cloud Service SDK.](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/aem-as-a-cloud-service-sdk.md)
1. When launching the SDK Quickstart, include the argument `-r prerelease`.

The value is sticky so it can only be selected on the first startup. Reinstall the SDK to change the command line option.

Since there may be multiple AEM maintenance releases between monthly feature releases, you can download these new SDKs and reference the new SDK API Jar versions in maven projects. The maintenance releases will not add additional prerelease features, but could include other smaller changes such as bug fixes, security fixes, and performance enhancements.
Javadocs are published to Maven Central.

#### Build Against the Prerelease SDK {#build-sdk}

1. Modify your maven project's `pom.xml` to reference a distinct prerelease SDK API jar, which is published to Maven Central. It contains any new Java API for the prerelease features and has a dependency on the SDK API jar. It uses the same version.

   As an example, here is a snippet from the parent pom's dependency management section referencing the regular API jar:

   ```
   <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
            <artifactId>aem-sdk-api</artifactId>
            <version>${aem.sdk.api}</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
   ```
        
   And then the usage in a module:

   ```
    <dependencies>
     <dependency>
         <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
         <artifactId>aem-sdk-api</artifactId>
     </dependency>
   ```

   In order to change to the prerelease SDK, simply change the dependency from `com.adobe.aem:aem-sdk-api` to `com.adobe.aem:aem-prerelease-sdk-api` as noted below:

   ```
   <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
            <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
            <artifactId>aem-prerelease-sdk-api</artifactId>
            <version>${aem.sdk.api}</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
      </dependency>
   <dependencies>
      <dependency>
         <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
         <artifactId>aem-prerelease-sdk-api</artifactId>
      </dependency>
   ```

   As usual, individual projects can use the dependency.

1. Deploy to your local server.

1. If satisfied that it works as expected locally, commit code to a development branch and use a Cloud Manager non-production pipeline to deploy to an environment that subscribes to the prerelease channel.

>[!CAUTION]
> 
> The `aem-prerelease-sdk-api` artifactId must never be used when deploying to stage or production. Always user the `aem-sdk-api` when deploying via the production pipeline. Similarly, code referencing prerelease APIs should not be deployed via the production pipeline.  

The [AEM CS SDK build Analyzer maven plugin v1.0 and higher](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/build-analyzer-maven-plugin.html#developing) will detect if the prerelease API is used in a project by inspecting the dependencies. If the analyzer finds it, it will use the prerelease SDK API to analyze the project.

## Considerations {#considerations}

There are a few items to note when using the prerelease channel.

* The prerelease channel does not necessarily contain all new features to be rolled out in the following release.
* Features in the prerelease are put through rigorous quality assurance and intended to be feature complete rather than beta quality. If you notice any issues, report them, just as you would do if you suspect bugs in features in a regular AEM release.  
* To determine if an environment is configured for the prerelease channel, go to the AEM console's **About** page and check if the AEM version number includes a *prerelease* suffix such as ```Adobe Experience Manager 2021.4.5226.20210427T070726Z-210429-PRERELEASE```.
