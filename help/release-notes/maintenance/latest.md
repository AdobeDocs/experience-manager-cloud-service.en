* GUIDES-26688: CSS and Page layout files in Native PDF templates exhibit inconsistent file locking behavior, allowing edits even when the files are locked.
* GUIDES-30900: Copying a folder with a large number of assets from the Assets UI leads to an API timeout. The operation continues to run in the backend and completes after some time, but no success or failure message, or notification is shown in the UI.
* GUIDES-29090: In the Native PDF output, the List of Index (LOI) appears in a non-alphabetical order and nested index terms are not grouped properly, making the index difficult to navigate.
* GUIDES-11227: Copying a DITA map from the Assets UI also copies its attached Baseline to the new map.
* GUIDES-31506: The Home page goes blank when one of the files listed in the Recent files widget is based on a template whose source template does not include a thumbnail.
