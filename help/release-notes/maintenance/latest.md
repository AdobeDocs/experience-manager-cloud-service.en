## Release 10675 {#release}

Summarized below are the continuous improvements for release 10675, which was publicly released on January 18th 2023. This release is an update from release 9850. 

IMPORTANT : DO NOT UPGRADE IF YOU ARE USING CORS. We identified an issue impacting GraphQL content delivery part on this release. A change in default AEM dispatcher config around how GraphQL persisted queries are cached can break the GraphQL content delivery of persisted queries for customers using a CORS configuration.
