### Known Issues {#known-issues-16799}

>[!NOTE]
> AEM Engineering has identified a regression for Launches functionality which is affecting current AEM releases starting with 16461. Because of this regression, new Launches (created after new releases have been applied) that include non-deep pages will not be properly promoted due to missing configurations.
> In case your environments are affected, a shell script to identify and update missing configurations is available through customer support (internal reference SITES-22457).
> A longer term fix will be made available that will ensure new Launches are created with all the right configurations. Until then, an internal patch release is also available on demand.

#### Forms

1.	If a user downloads the AEM Forms SDK version greater than `AEM Forms add-on v2024.05.04.00-240400`, the batch file fails to start the Docker service. To resolve this issue:
    1. Download the [folder](/help/forms/assets/sdk_hotfix.zip).
    1. Extract the contents from the downloaded folder and copy the `sdk.sh` and `sdk.bat` files.
