* SITES-16055: Fix Live Copy and Live Copy Source links within respective properties page.
* SCRNS-4243: Missing buttons in Content Provider for Non-Admin users.
* FORMS-13827: In the Adaptive Forms Rule Editor, the WHEN operation does not currently support different types of fields with date pickers.
* FORMS-13786: In the Adaptive Forms Rule Editor, the drag-and-drop functionality is not working for custom functions.
* FORMS-13587: In the Adaptive Forms Editor, the Device Emulator feature is not functioning correctly for Core Components based Adaptive Forms.

* FORMS-13829: The dropdown, controlled by rules to mimic radio button functionality, fails to populate correctly after a selection is cleared and reselected.

* FORMS-13896: In DoR (Document of Record) output, dates, and numbers are displayed in Arabic regardless of whether the input data is merged using Gregorian numbers.
