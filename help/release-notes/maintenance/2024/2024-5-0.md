* FORMS-11952: When a form is submitted, the submit URL generated by the form starts with /content/ instead of /portale/, misrouting the request. This prevents the request from reaching the intended servers.
* FORMS-13587: In the Adaptive Forms Editor, the Device Emulator feature is not functioning correctly for Core Components based Adaptive Forms.
* FORMS-13616: The date picker is showing the current date as one day behind, likely due to a timezone issue, and there's difficulty in setting the correct date format due to this inconsistency and an additional display pattern problem.

* FORMS-13801: Even if the terms and conditions component is disabled, the corresponding checkbox remains enabled.

* FORMS-13829: The dropdown, controlled by rules to mimic radio button functionality, fails to populate correctly after a selection is cleared and reselected. The desired behavior is for individual checkboxes to act as radio buttons, allowing only one selection at a time and permitting deselection of all options.

* FORMS-14244: In an Adaptive Form based on an XDP with embedded scripts on checkboxes, the scripts are not executed for elements after such checkboxes.
* FORMS-14267: Users are experiencing consistent timeout errors when sending API requests across development, stage, and production environments. These requests are related to generating PDFs, sometimes with data prefilled using data binding. The issue results in a hanging process that eventually times out but succeeds upon retrying after the error.

### Known Issues {#known-issues-16357}

* Some users may face issue while creating forms on `Cloud Service version 2024.5.16461`, the issue is, when a user creates a form, the following error message pops up in the creation dialog box:

  `A server error occurred. Try again after sometime.`

  The issue occurs because the author publishes the form without first publishing the template used in the form, which results in the addition of the `jcr:uuid` and other protected and system-generated properties to the `<template-path>/initial/jcr:content` node. This cause failures in subsequent form creation.

  Follow the given steps to resolve the issue:

  1. Ensure that the template you use in your form does not have the `jcr:uuid` and other system generated protected properties at the path `<template-path>/initial/jcr:content` node.
  1. Publish the template explicitly using the template console.
  1. Now, when your template is published, try creating new forms using the template.
  1. If the template you used updates in the future releases, publish the template again (as given in the step 2) to prevent form creation failure issues.
