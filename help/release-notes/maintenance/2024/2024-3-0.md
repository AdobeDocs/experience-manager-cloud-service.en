### Change Notice {#change-notice-15262}

**Actions Required**

#### Set CM Java Version to 11 {#set-java-version-11-15262}

The new version of the aem-sdk-api contains classes compiled with a Java 11 target, which is not compatible with the Cloud Manager Build environment default JDK version 1.8. This update requires that Maven is executed using JDK 11.

Customers are advised to add a `.cloudmanager/java-version` file to the root of their git repo with the contents: `11`. See [Build Environment / Setting the Maven JDK Version](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/build-environment-details.md#alternate-maven-jdk-version).

#### Update aem-cloud-testing-clients to 1.2.1 {#update-aem-cloud-testing-clients-15262}

Upcoming changes will require the library [aem-cloud-testing-clients](https://github.com/adobe/aem-testing-clients) used in your custom functional tests to be updated to at least version **1.2.1**

Make sure that your dependency in `it.tests/pom.xml` has been updated.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.adobe.cq</groupId>
   <artifactId>aem-cloud-testing-clients</artifactId>
   <version>1.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

This change needs to be performed before April 6, 2024.

Failing to update the dependency library will result in pipeline failures at the "Custom Functional Testing" step.
