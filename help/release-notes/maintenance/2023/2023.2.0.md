### Known Issues {#known-issues-11382}

- SITES-12573 - GraphQL queries using variables inside a filter fails if one variable is not specified. Please do not update to this release shall you use GraphQL with AEM as a Cloud Service.
- SKYOPS-51970 - Identified regression of the FACT version used in the buildImage step, leading to un-matching user mapping.
- GRANITE-44542 - Issues have been reported for customers who did not specify a package nodetype (by providing a .content.xml with jcr:primaryType) for folders included in the package filter. This caused these folders to be treated as nt:folder, creating issues in various cases.
- SKYOPS-56928 - Apache HTTPD regression might cause 404 errors. If you experience those issues, for safety reasons, it is recommended to rollback to the previous version and to avoid any pipeline running during that time period.
