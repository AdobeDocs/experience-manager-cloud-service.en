- SKYOPS-51970 - Identified regression of the FACT version used in the buildImage step, leading to unmatching user mapping.
- GRANITE-44542 - Issues have been reported for customers who did not specify a package nodetype (by providing a .content.xml with jcr:primaryType) for folders included in the package filter. This caused these folders to be treated as nt:folder, creating issues in various cases.
