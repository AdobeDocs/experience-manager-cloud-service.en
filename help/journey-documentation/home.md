# AEM Documentation Journeys {#aem-documentation-journeys}

Documentation Journeys provide a narrative structure within AEM documentation by tying together complex and disparate features in order to solve a business goal in a best-practices fashion. Designed with AEM beginners in mind, journeys introduce the concepts and features to achieve a goal from A to Z.

## What is a Documentation Journey? {#what-is}

A Documentation Journey ties together many different and perhaps complicated topics and features by providing a narrative that helps the reader, who can be new to AEM, understand and solve a business problem from beginning to end, while assuming minimal prior topic knowledge.

This contrasts with AEM's existing technical docs that primarily focus on a single feature and documentation of tasks, assuming familiarity with AEM. By focusing on the concepts and deferring to the existing technical documentation for in-depth details, Documentation Journeys give readers new to AEM a place to begin understanding how the platform can be leveraged by using best practices to address common business needs and workflows. For this reason Documentation Journeys serve as a complement to and not a replacement for [AEM's existing technical documentation.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service.html)

## How is a Documentation Journey Structured? {#structure}

A Documentation Journey serves as a best practices based introduction to how AEM solves common business problems. For this reason, each journey is designed with readers new to AEM in mind, laying out the business problem, describing any necessary theory, and then giving a step-by-step overview of how AEM solves the problem. Because of the comprehensive nature of a journey, it can be useful to those new to AEM as well as experienced users.

A typical Documentation Journey will have the following parts.

* Overview of the goals of the journey and the intended audience
* Description of business problem
* Description of any theory necessary that will be used to solve the problem
* Prerequisites and requirements
* Description of intended audience
* Implementation steps

A Documentation Journey's goal is to familiarize the reader with the basics of how AEM uses different features and tools to solve a single business problem. For this reason, the implementation steps illustrate the most common usage patterns and most important features and options. Detailed configuration options are linked to in the technical documentation for further reading.

## Who Should Read Documentation Journeys? {#who}

AEM Documentation Journeys' main goal is to help readers new to AEM understand how many different and powerful features of the system can be used together to solve common business problems by way of a narrative.

So if you are new to AEM and have a specific business case in mind and want an overview of how AEM can solve it, Documentation Journeys are where you want to start.

However there are many different types of AEM users with different needs and expectations. For example:

* Administrators
* Developers
* Content Authors
* Translation Specialists
* Content Architects

Each journey begins with a clear statement of the intended audience for the journey. Because no one works in a vacuum, when the reader requires the assistance of input of a system user or persona, this is clearly explained within the journey.

## How do Documentation Journeys Fit into Other AEM Documentation? {#compare}

Documentation Journeys are intended as a complement to existing AEM technical documentation and tutorials. For example, a journey may introduce you to a concept, and then the technical docs will explain the detailed configuration options you may need and a tutorial will guide you through specific setups.
