## Onboarding {#onboarding}

The onboarding for AEM Commerce as a Cloud Service is a two-step process:

1. Get AEM Commerce as a Cloud Service enabled and the CIF add-on provisioned
2. Connect AEM Commerce as a Cloud Service with your commerce solution

The first onboarding step is done by Adobe. For more details on pricing and provisioning, you need to reach out to your sales representative.

Once you have been provisioned with the CIF add-on, it will be applied to any existing Cloud Manager programs. In case, you don't have a Cloud Manager Program, you will need to create a new one. For more details, refer to [Setup your Program](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/getting-started/setting-up-program.html).

The second step is self-service for each AEM as a Cloud Service environment. There are some additional configurations you will need to do after the initial provisioning of the CIF add-on.
