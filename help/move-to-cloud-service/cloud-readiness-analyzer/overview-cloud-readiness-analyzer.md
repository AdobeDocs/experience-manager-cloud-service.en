# Overview {#overview-cloud-readiness-analyzer}

The Cloud Readiness Analyzer helps accelerate the processes of assessing readiness to move from an existing Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) deployment to AEM as a Cloud Service.
 
This tool generates a report that identifies areas of potential refactoring, which is the first step in the transition journey to AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Cloud Readiness Analyzer Report {#cra-report}

The Cloud Readiness Analyzer Report is used to gain a high-level understanding of general upgrade readiness. The report consists of findings within categories of issues that must be addressed before a successful deployment to AEM as a Cloud Service. 

The Cloud Readiness Analyzer report includes the following categories:
 
* Application functionality that must be refactored
* Repository items that must be moved to a supported location
* Legacy user interface dialogs and components that must be modernized
* Deployment and configuration issues
* AEM 6.x features that have been replaced by new functionality or that are currently not supported on AEM as a Cloud Service
 
Additional information about the categories and possible implications and solutions associated with those categories are provided via links from within the Cloud Readiness Analyzer Report.
 
>[!NOTE]
>The Cloud Readiness Analyzer Report speeds up the process of estimating the time and cost that is required to transition to AEM as a Cloud Service by providing information that would otherwise have to be manually gathered and evaluated.
 
You can also download the Cloud Readiness Analyzer report from your AEM instance. Refer to [Viewing the Cloud Readiness Analyzer Report](/help/move-to-cloud-service/cloud-readiness-analyzer/using-cloud-readiness-analyzer.md#viewing-report) for more details.
