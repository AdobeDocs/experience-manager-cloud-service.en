# Overview {#overview-cloud-readiness-analyzer}

Assessing the readiness to move from an existing AEM instance to AEM as a Cloud Service and determining areas that will require refactoring is the first step in the journey to AEM as a Cloud Service. Using Cloud Readiness Analyzer (CRA) accelerates these steps.

CRA detects and reports patterns that:

* Use an AEM 6.x feature that is currently not supported on Cloud Service

* Violate certain rules, configurations or usage that will be affected by the move to Cloud Service

CRA generates a summary report that can be used to gain a high-level understanding of general upgrade readiness.  The report organizes the findings by categories and sub-types within those categories. Additional information about the categories and possible implications and solutions associated with those categories are provided via links from within the summary report.  

>[!NOTE]
>The output of the CRA helps speeds up the process of estimating time and cost that will be required to move to AEM as a Cloud Service.
