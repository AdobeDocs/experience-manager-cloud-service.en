# Overview {#overview-cloud-readiness-analyzer}

The Cloud Readiness Analyzer assists in assessing the readiness to move from an existing AEM instance to AEM as a Cloud Service. 

This tool determines areas that require refactoring, which is the first step in the transition journey to AEM as a Cloud Service. 

CRA detects and reports patterns that:

* Use an AEM 6.x feature that is currently not supported on AEM as a Cloud Service

* Violate certain rules, configurations or usage that will be affected by the move to AEM as a Cloud Service

## Summary Report in Cloud Readiness Analyzer {#summary-report}

The Cloud Readiness Analyzer generates a summary report that can be used to gain a high-level understanding of general upgrade readiness.

The report organizes the findings by categories and sub-types within those categories. Additional information about the categories and possible implications and solutions associated with those categories are provided via links from within the summary report.  

>[!NOTE]
>The output of the Cloud Readiness Analyzer helps speeds up the process of estimating time and cost that is required in transitioning to AEM as a Cloud Service.
