# Getting Started with Cloud Acceleration Manager {#get-started-cam}

Cloud Acceleration Manager is a free cloud-based application that provides an assessment of a customer's current AEM implementation and helps manage their journey to AEM as a Cloud Service following Adobeâ€™s recommended migration methodology.

## Using Cloud Acceleration Manager {#using-cam}

Migration to AEM as a Cloud Service can appear to be confusing and complicated and customers/partners often do not know the next step to take in the migration journey.

Cloud Acceleration Manager provides customers and partners with a one-stop experience for migrations in the form of a migration wizard that guides them throughout the journey by providing with an initial assessment, pointing them to the right tools, documentation and best practices to ensure a successful Go-live in AEM as a Cloud Service.
