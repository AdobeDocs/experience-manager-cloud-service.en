# Repository Modernizer {#repo-modernizer}
Repositor Modernizer is a utility developed to separate content and code into discrete packages to be compatible with the project structure definition for Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service.

## Introduction {#introduction}
Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service brings many new features and possibilities into your AEM projects. However, there are some changes required to Adobe Experience Manager Maven projects to be compatible with AEM Cloud Service. At a high-level, AEM requires a separation of **content** and **code** into discrete sub-packages to respect the split between mutable and immutable content. Please refer to [AEM Project Structure](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/developing/aem-project-content-package-structure.html) for more details about the new AEM project structure for Cloud Service.
