# Implementation Phase in Cloud Acceleration Manager {#implementation-phase-cam}

The Implementation Phase includes:

* [Local Development](#local-development)
* [Code Refactoring](#code-refactoring)
* [AEM as a Cloud Service Deployment](#aem-as-a-cloud-service-deployment)
* [Content Transfer](#content-transfer)


Click your project card so you can open the project landing page and navigate to the **Implementation** section, as shown in the following figure.

## Using Code Refactoring Card {#code-refactoring}

The Code Refactoring activity card provides all the relevant information and highlights the code refactoring areas to review and resolve when moving to AEM as a Cloud Service.

Follow this section so you can explore the Code Refactoring activity card:

1. Click **Review** from the **Code Refactoring** activity card.

   ![image](/help/journey-migration/cloud-acceleration-manager/assets/implementation-4.png)

1. The page displays the list of code refactoring activities organized by the severity level. You can learn more by clicking the two highlighted icons. 

   The page displays the code refactoring considerations in three different tabs: 

   * Overview
   * Dispatcher
   * Testing

  >[!NOTE]
  >Review the content in these tabs to understand some additional areas that are not covered by the Best Practices Analyzer.
   
   The **Dispatcher** tab provides information on how to structure the AEM as a Cloud Service Apache and Dispatcher configurations, and how to validate and run it locally before deploying to Cloud environments. It also describes debugging in Cloud environments.

## Using AEM as a Cloud Service Deployment Card {#aem-as-a-cloud-service-deployment}

AEM as a Cloud Service Deployment card provides all the relevant content that helps you deploy your code to AEM as a Cloud Service.

Follow this section so you can explore AEM as a Cloud Service Deployment Card activity card:

1. Click **View** from the **AEM as a Cloud Service Deployment** activity card.

   ![image](/help/journey-migration/cloud-acceleration-manager/assets/implementation-6.png)

1. A content carousel displays the relevant information for this phase of the migration journey.

## Using Content Transfer Card {#content-transfer}

The Content Transfer card lets you start and manage content transfer from your current AEM instance to AEM as a Cloud Service. 

Follow this section so you can explore the Content Transfer activity card:

1. Click **Review** from the **Content Transfer** activity card.

   ![image](/help/journey-migration/cloud-acceleration-manager/assets/contenttransfer-1.png)

1. To start a content transfer, you must create a Migration set. Click **Create migration set**. A migration set allows content to be transferred to AEM as a Cloud Service. 

   ![image](/help/journey-migration/cloud-acceleration-manager/assets/contenttransfer-2.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >A migration set expires after a prolonged period of inactivity. See [Migration Set Expiry](/help/journey-migration/content-transfer-tool/using-content-transfer-tool/overview-content-transfer-tool.md#migration-set-expiry) for details.

   >[!NOTE]
   >See [prerequisites](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/migration-journey/cloud-migration/content-transfer-tool/prerequisites-content-transfer-tool.html) and the [best practices and guidelines](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/migration-journey/cloud-migration/content-transfer-tool/overview-content-transfer-tool.html) before using the Content Transfer Tool.

1. Download and install the Content Transfer Tool to populate the migration set and complete the Extraction phase of content transfer. Review [Getting Started with Content Transfer Tool](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/migration-journey/cloud-migration/content-transfer-tool/getting-started-content-transfer-tool.html) to learn how to use the Content Transfer Tool.

1. To ingest content from the Migration set into an environment on AEM as a Cloud Service, you must start an ingestion. Navigate to **Ingestion Jobs** and click **New ingestion**. Review [Ingesting Content into Target](/help/journey-migration/content-transfer-tool/using-content-transfer-tool/ingesting-content.md) so you can learn how to complete the Ingestion phase of content transfer.

<!--### Estimating Content Transfer Time {#calculating}

A Content Transfer Tool calculator has been provided to estimate how long it could take to complete the content transfer activity. You can use the content repository size slider to select the size that applies to your project. The transfer times vary for the extraction and ingestion phases. 

   ![image](/help/journey-migration/cloud-acceleration-manager/assets/contenttransfer-4.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >These times are estimates only. Factor such as network speeds and time to scale up instances have not been accounted for in these estimates.

To estimate the size of the AEM Repository, you can run the Disk Usage report under `http://HOST:PORT/etc/reports/diskusage.html`. 

You can also estimate the size of specific repository paths by using the `path` parameter, for example, `http://HOST:PORT/etc/reports/diskusage.html?path=/content/dam`. -->

## What's Next {#whats-next}

After you have learned how to log on to Cloud Acceleration Manager and how to use the Implementation phase, you are ready to move on to reviewing the next step in the [Go Live Phase](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/migration-journey/cloud-acceleration-manager/using-cam/cam-golive-phase.html).
