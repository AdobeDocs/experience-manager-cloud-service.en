# Readiness Phase in Cloud Acceleration Manager {#readiness-phase-cam}

Once you have created a project in Cloud Acceleration Manager, you can now start the assessment of your current Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) implementation in the Readiness phase.

The Readiness Phase includes:

* [Best Practices Analysis](#best-practices-analysis)
* [Planning and Setup](#planning-setup) 

Follow the steps below to navigate to the Readiness Phase:

1. Click your project card.

## Using Best Practices Analysis Card {#best-practices-analysis}

>abstract="The BPA report can be uploaded to CAM to provide an analysis of it with respect to migration to AEM as a Cloud Service."
>additional-url="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/migration-journey/cloud-migration/best-practices-analyzer/using-best-practices-analyzer" text="Using Best Practices Analyzer"

1. Click **Review** from the **Best Practices Analysis** card. 

   ![image](/help/journey-migration/cloud-acceleration-manager/assets/readiness-2.png)

1. Run the Best Practices Analyzer (BPA).

   >[!NOTE]
   >To avoid an impact on business critical instances, Adobe recommends that you run BPA on an Author environment. The environment should be as close as possible to the Production environment in the areas of customizations, configurations, content, and user applications. Alternatively, it can be run on a clone of the production Author environment.

   1. Follow the instructions in the [Using Best Practices Analyzer page](/help/journey-migration/best-practices-analyzer/using-best-practices-analyzer.md) to install and run the BPA tool, using the key in the next step to automatically upload the report to CAM.

1. Click **Get upload key**, so you can get the key used to configure your system to automatically upload BPA reports directly to CAM.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >The report can still be uploaded manually, but using the Upload Key streamlines the operation. Note that the report cannot be uploaded manually if you are in the browser's Incognito mode.

1. After you have uploaded a new report, you can see the Best Practices Analysis report in CAM.

   ![image](/help/journey-migration/cloud-acceleration-manager/assets/cam-bpareport.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >If multiple, different reports are uploaded, the report that is displayed in detail is always the one that has the most recent creation date (not upload date).

1. Review and explore the Best Practices Analysis dashboard in CAM. See [Reviewing Best Practices Analysis Report](#analysis-report) for more details.

   >[!NOTE]
   >Uploading a new report resets all the assessments if it is newer than the previously loaded report.

### Using Print Preview {#print-preview-cam}

You can select the print preview option in Cloud Acceleration Manager for a printable preview of the reports or to print the report to a PDF format for easy shareability.

Follow the steps below:

1. Click the **Print Preview** action.

   ![image](/help/journey-migration/best-practices-analyzer/assets/bpa-printpreview1b.png)

1. On the new tab with the report displayed in a printable preview, click **Print** to print the report to a PDF format.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >* The option **Save as PDF** is recommended and supported for the above functionality.
   >* If the browser's print button is used, it prints only one page.
