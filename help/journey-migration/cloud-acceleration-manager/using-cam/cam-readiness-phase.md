The Readiness Phase includes:

* [Best Practices Analysis](#best-practices-analysis)
* [Planning and Setup](#planning-setup) 

Follow the steps below to navigate to the Readiness Phase:

1. Download Best Practices Analyzer (BPA).

      >[!NOTE]
      >To avoid an impact on business critical instances, Adobe recommends that you run BPA on an Author environment. The environment should be as close as possible to the Production environment in the areas of customizations, configurations, content, and user applications. Alternatively, it can be run on a clone of the production Author environment.

   1. Navigate to the [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aemcloud.html) portal and download the Best Practices Analyzer as a zip file.

      >[!NOTE]
      >Review [Using Best Practices Analyzer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/migration-journey/cloud-migration/best-practices-analyzer/using-best-practices-analyzer.html?lang=en#imp-considerations) to learn how to run BPA.

   1. Export the report in a CSV format 

1. Click **Upload new report** so you can upload BPA report in CAM.
