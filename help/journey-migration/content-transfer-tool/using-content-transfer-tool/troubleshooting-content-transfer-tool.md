# Troubleshooting Content Transfer Tool {#troubleshoot-content-transfer-tool}


## Missing Blob IDs {#missing-blobs}

If there are missing blob ids reported, as mentioned below, then there is a need to execute a consistency check in the existing repository and restore the missing blobs.
`ERROR o.a.j.o.p.b.AbstractSharedCachingDataStore - Error retrieving record [ba45c53f8b687e7056c85dceebf8156a0e6abc7e]`

The following command is executed 

>[!NOTE]
>
>`--verbose` flag is required to report the node paths from where the blobs are referenced.

**For repositories AEM 6.5 (Oak 1.8 and below)**

```shell
java -jar oak-run.jar datastorecheck --consistency --store [<SEGMENT_STORE_PATH>|<MONGO_URI>] --[s3ds|fds] <DATASTORE_CFG> --verbose <OUT_DIR> --dump
```

**For repositories having Oak > 1.10**

```shell
java -jar oak-run.jar datastore --check-consistency [<SEGMENT_STORE_PATH>|<MONGO_URI>] --[s3ds|fds|azureds] <DATASTORE_CFG> --out-dir <OUT_DIR> --work-dir <TEMP_DIR> --verbose

```

Refer to [Oak Runnable Jar](https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/tree/trunk/oak-run) for more details.

The files created in the *OUT_DIR* specified above for consistency can then be checked for paths missing binaries and appropriate action taken like restoring from a backup, deleting the paths, re-indexing, and so on.
