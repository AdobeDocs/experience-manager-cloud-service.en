| Considerations                                                     | What is Currently Supported                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AEM Version                                                        | Content Transfer Tool can be run on AEM 6.3 or higher versions only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Size of Segment Store                                              | An existing repository that has less than 750 million JCR nodes and up to 500 GB (online compacted size) on *Author* and 50 GB on *Publish* are currently supported. Create a support ticket with Adobe Customer Care so you can discuss options for segment store size above these limits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Total Size of Content Repository <br>*(segment store + data store)* | Content Transfer Tool is designed to transfer content up to 20 terabytes for File Data Store type of data store. Anything higher than 20 terabytes is not currently supported. Create a support ticket with Adobe Customer Care so you can discuss options for content larger than 20 terabytes. <br>To significantly speed up the content transfer process for large repositories, an optional [pre-copy](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/migration-journey/cloud-migration/content-transfer-tool/handling-large-content-repositories.html#setting-up-pre-copy-step) step can be used. This process applies to File Data Store, Amazon S3, and Azure Data Store types of data store. For Amazon S3 and Azure Data Store, repository sizes greater than 20 terabytes is supported. |
| Total Lucene Index Size                                            | Total Lucene Index size of 25 GB maximum, excluding `/oak:index/lucene` and `/oak:index/damAssetLucene` is supported. Create a support ticket with Adobe Customer Care so you can discuss options for index size above this limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Content in Immutable Paths                                         | Content Transfer Tool cannot be used to migrate content in immutable paths. To transfer content from `/etc`, you can select certain `/etc` paths, but only to support [AEM Forms to AEM Forms as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/setup-configure-migrate/migrate-to-forms-as-a-cloud-service.html#paths-of-various-aem-forms-specific-assets). For all other use-cases, see [Common Repository Restructuring](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/restructuring/all-repository-restructuring-in-aem-6-5.html) to learn more about repository restructuring.                                                                                    |
| Node property value in MongoDB                                     | Node property values stored in MongoDB cannot exceed 16 MB. This rule is enforced by MongoDB. Ingestions fail if there are property values larger than this limit. Before running an extraction, run this [oak-run](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak-run/1.38.0/oak-run-1.38.0.jar) script. Review all large property values and validate if they are needed. The ones that exceed 16 MB must be converted to Binary values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
