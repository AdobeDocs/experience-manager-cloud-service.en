>[!NOTE]
>
>Deleting a migration set from Cloud Acceleration Manager (CAM) does not delete it from the Content Transfer Tool. Once a migration set is deleted from CAM, the user will not be able to run extractions on that migration set from the Content Transfer wizard. However, if the migration set was deleted from the Content Transfer wizard, the user can re-create as long as the migration set is still available in Cloud Acceleration Manager.

>To keep the Content Transfer Tool in sync with the Cloud Acceleration Manager, the user can also delete the migration set from the Content Transfer Tool.

To delete the migration set from the Content Transfer wizard, select the migration set and click on **Delete** in the action bar.
