# Overview {#overview-ct}

The Content Transformer (CT) is a tool developed by Adobe that can be used to automatically detect and fix content related issues reported by the [Best Practices Analyzer (BPA)](/help/journey-migration/best-practices-analyzer/overview-best-practices-analyzer.md) before migrating content from your current AEM implementation (On-premise or Managed Services) to AEM as a Cloud Service.

The Content Transformer can help resolve issues that fall under the following [BPA pattern categories](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-pattern-detection/table-of-contents/aso.html) (shown in table below) by allowing users to take bulk actions such as move or delete. This can significantly reduce the time and reduce the complexity associated with a migration project.

## Benefits provided by the Content Transformer {#benefits}

The Content Transformer provides the following benefits:

* Fail-safe: a package is created by the Content Transformer every time it makes any modification to the repository to fix issues. If needed, you can revert back to the previous state by installing the package.
* Easy-to-use: the Content Transformer has been integrated with the Content Transfer Tool and comes with a simple user interface that is intuitive. 
* Saves time: when you have a high number of content issues that fall under one pattern category, you can resolve all of them with just a couple of clicks using the Content Transformer.
