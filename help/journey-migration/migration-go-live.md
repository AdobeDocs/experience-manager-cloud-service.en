# Performing the migration {performing-migration}

In this part of the journey, you will learn how to perform the migration once the code and the content are ready to be moved over to AEM as a Cloud Service.

## The Story So Far {#story-so-far}

In the previous steps of the journey, you learned how to [determine if your deployment is ready to be moved to the cloud](/help/journey-migration/readiness.md) as well as [the tools through which you can make your code and content cloud ready](/help/journey-migration/making-your-code-and-content-cloud-ready.md).

## Objective {#objective}

This document will help you understand how to complete the migration to AEM as a Cloud Service once you performed the previous steps of the journey.

## Completing the migration {completing-the-migration}

To ensure a smooth and successful migration to AEM as a Cloud Service, you should consider executing the following steps:

* Schedule code and content freeze period
* Perform final content top-up
* Complete testing iterations
* Run performance and security tests
* Cut-Over

## What's Next {#what-is-next}

Once you understand how to complete the migration to AEM as a Cloud Service, you can check the best practices page to keep your instance running smoothly.
