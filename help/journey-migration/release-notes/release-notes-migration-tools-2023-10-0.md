* Changes have been made to the content ingestion process - It is no longer required to submit a Customer Care/Support ticket to disable the AEM Version Updates on the destination environment. This process is now automated. For more details, refer to [AEM Version Updates and Ingestions](/help/journey-migration/content-transfer-tool/using-content-transfer-tool/ingesting-content.md#aem-version-updates-and-ingestions)
* Dynamic concurrency will be used during the [pre-copy](/help/journey-migration/content-transfer-tool/using-content-transfer-tool/handling-large-content-repositories.md) step in both extraction and ingestion phases, significantly reducing the content migration time.
