* BPA can now detect and report on whether the customer has added a custom logger configuration. AEM as a Cloud Service does not support custom log files. All log files need to be piped to `error.log`
* BPA can now report on the different binary MIME types present in the customer's repository and counts associated with them.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-bpa}

* The BPA UI had rendering issues when displaying a large number of findings under a single pattern. This has been fixed.
