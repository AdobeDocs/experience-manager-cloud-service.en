Adobe Experience Manager Dispatcher Converter converts existing configurations on AEM Dispatcher to configurations on AEM as a Cloud Service Dispatcher.

## Introduction to Dispatcher {#introduction-dispatcher}

Dispatcher is Adobe Experience Manager's caching, or load-balancing, or both, tool. Using AEM's Dispatcher also helps to protect your AEM server from attack. Therefore, you can increase the security of your AEM instance by using the Dispatcher with an enterprise-class web server.

>[!NOTE]
>The most common use of Dispatcher is to cache responses from an **AEM publish instance**, to increase the responsiveness and security of your externally facing published website.

See [Dispatcher Overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/dispatcher.html) to learn how Dispatcher performs caching, returns documents and performs Load Balancing.
