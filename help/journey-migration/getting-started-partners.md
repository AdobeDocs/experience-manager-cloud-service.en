## Developer Journey in Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service {#developer-journey}

### Developing 

The fundamentals of code development are similar in Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service compared to the Adobe Experience Manager On Premise and Managed Services solutions. 

Developers write code and test it locally, which is then pushed to remote Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service environments. 

See self-help resources about implementation for Experience Manager as a Cloud Service to learn how to customize your Experience Manager as a Cloud Service deployment.

### Deploying

 Developers write code and test it locally, which is then pushed to remote AEM as a Cloud Service environments. 
  
  Cloud Manager, which was an optional content delivery tool for Managed Services, is required. This is now the sole mechanism for deploying code to AEM as a Cloud Service environments.

## Moving to Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service {#move-to-cloud}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="aemcloud_move_to_cloud"
>title="Moving to Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service"
>abstract="This one-pager outlines the recommended phased approach to transition customers from various Experience Manager deployments to Experience Manager as a Cloud Service and help existing customers deliver connected, continuous experiences on this modern, purpose-built platform for experience management."

**Experience Manager as a Cloud Service provides a scalable, secure, and agile technology foundation for Experience Manager Sites and Assets, enabling marketers and IT to focus on delivering impactful experiences at scale.**
 
With Experience Manager as a Cloud Service, your teams can focus on innovating instead of planning for product upgrades. New product features are thoroughly tested and delivered to your teams without any interruption so that they always have access to the state-of-the-art application.

The transition journey to Cloud Service involves three phases - Planning, Execution, and Post Go-live.
For a successful and smooth transition, you should ensure proper planning and adhere to best practices outlined in this Guide.

The figure below shows a high-level representation of the recommended transition journey to Cloud Service.

![image](/help/journey-migration/assets/home-img1.png)

<br>

### Planning

Before beginning your transition journey to Cloud Service, you should familiarize yourself with Experience Manager as a Cloud Service and review the notable changes that have been made to it and also review the features that have been replaced or deprecated.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Project discovery and assessment</td>
<td><ul><li>Refer to <a href="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/release-notes/aem-cloud-changes.html?lang=en">Notable Changes to Experience Manager as a Cloud Service</a> to understand the important differences between Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service and Experience Manager 6.x.</li><li>Refer to <a href="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/release-notes/deprecated-removed-features.html?lang=en">Deprecated Features</a> to learn more about features and capabilities that have been marked as deprecated.</li><li>[For Cloud Service Migrations only] Assessing Cloud Service Readiness : Run the <a href="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/migration-journey/cloud-migration/best-practices-analyzer/overview-best-practices-analyzer.html?lang=en">Best Practices Analyzer(BPA)</a> on source environment </li><li>Complete an assessment against notable changes and deprecated features in Experience Manager CS</li></ul></td>

</tr>
</table>

<br>

### Execution

Before you start the Execution phase of a project, you should be on-boarded to Cloud Service. You also need to familiarize yourself with Cloud Manager. This is the mechanism for deploying project code to an Experience Manager Cloud Service instance.

Cloud Manager enables organizations to self-manage Experience Manager in the Cloud. It includes a continuous integration and continuous delivery ([CI/CD](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/content/overview/ci-cd-pipelines.html?lang=en)) framework that lets IT teams and implementation partners expedite the delivery of customizations or updates without compromising performance or security.

#### Content Migration

1. [Content Transfer Tool](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/migration/content-transfer-tool.html?lang=en#migration) : used to move existing content over from a source AEM instance (on-premise or AMS) to the target AEM Cloud Service instance.
2. [Package Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/contentmanagement/package-manager.html?lang=en#package-manager) : used for importing and exporting of mutable content of the repository.

  5. Perform recommended testing cycles (smoke, QA and more)
  6. Promote to the Cloud Manager Production Pipeline 
  7. Smoke test validation
  8. Go-Live 

<br>

### Post Go-Live

In the Post Go-live phase, you should ensure clean-up of temporary files, review best practices for continuous development and manage logs.
