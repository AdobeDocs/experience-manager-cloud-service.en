# AEM Reference Demos Add-On Journey {#reference-demos-add-on-journey}

Start here for a guided journey through how to easily add the AEM Reference Demos Add-On to a sandbox environment with minimal AEM configuration and be able to test the powerful features of AEM Sites and AEM Screens with rich examples based on best-practices.

## Introduction {#introduction}

AEM is a powerful tool set for creating and managing digital experiences. Content authors can easily create digital experiences using the sites editor and organize the content using the sites console, all while being able to see the content live as it will be delivered by AEM to your audiences across channels.

Without sample content and configuration, it can be difficult to test the powerful features of AEM for new and experienced clients alike. The AEM Reference Demos Add-On allows for the easy creation of sandbox environments pre-loaded with sample content and pre-configured using the latest Adobe best practices guidelines. With the add-on, you can easily evaluate AEM Sites and AEM Screens features in context and with hardly any configuration.

* **If you are new to AEM**, following this journey is the easiest way to get up-and-running with real content in an actual, fully-functioning AEM environment to allow you to test functionality and get to know the capabilities of AEM.
* **If you are an experienced AEM user**, following this journey is the easiest way to set up a separate demo environment for testing purposes or create a POC using new functionality.

Whatever your particular need, if you need an AEM environment filled with realistic, fully-functioning, sample content, setting up a sandbox with the AEM Reference Demo Add-On is for you. Keep reading!

## AEM Documentation Journeys {#documentation-journeys}

[A Documentation Journey](/help/journey-documentation/documentation-journeys.md) ties together many different and perhaps complicated topics and features by providing a narrative that helps the reader, who can be new to AEM, understand and solve a business problem from beginning to end, while assuming minimal prior topic or AEM knowledge.

Documentation Journeys are designed around best practices principles, informed by Adobe's latest research, proven implementation experience from Adobe consultants, and feedback from customer projects.

If you want to know how Adobe recommends how to solve sites business cases with AEM, AEM Sites Journeys are where to start.

## Audience {#audience}

This journey lays out the requirements, steps, and approach to create a new program and set up an AEM sandbox with the AEM Reference Demos Add-On including Sites and/or Screens demo content. Its primary audience is the **system administrator** who is assigned the role **Business Owner** in Cloud Manager. This is usually the same person who would be in charge of environment management. However once the Reference Demos Add-On is installed, that administrator may grant other users access to the AEM environment in order to test the features that have been enabled by the add-on.
