# Enable AEM Screens for Your Demo Site {#enable-screens}

Learn the steps to enable the full AEM Screens as a Cloud Service experience on your demo site.

## The Story So Far {#story-so-far}

In the previous document of the AEM Reference Demos Add-On journey, [Create Demo Site,](create-site.md) you created a new demo site based on the templates of the Reference Demo Add-On. You should now:

* Understand how to access the AEM authoring environment.
* Know how to create a site based on a template.
* Understand the basics of navigating the site structure and editing a page.

Now that you have your own demo site to explore and understand the tools available to help you manage your demo sites, you can now enable the full AEM Screens as a Cloud Service experience for your demo sites.

## Objective {#objective}

The AEM Reference Demos Add-On contains AEM Screens content for We.Cafe, a coffee shop business vertical. This document helps you understand how to execute the We.Cafe demo setup in the context of AEM Screens. After reading you should:

* Know the basics of AEM Screens.
* Understand the We.Cafe demo content.
* Know how to configure AEM Screens for We.Cafe.
  * Know how to create a Screens project for We.Cafe.
  * Be able to configure a simulated weather service using Google Sheets and APIs.
  * Simulate dynamically changing Screens content based on your "weather service."
  * Install and use the screens player.

## Understand Screens {#understand-screens}

AEM Screens as a Cloud Service is a digital signage solution that allows marketers to create and manage dynamic digital experiences at scale. With AEM Screens as a Cloud Service, you can create engaging and dynamic digital signage experiences intended to be consumed in public spaces.

>[!TIP]
>
>For the full details of AEM Screens as a Cloud Service, see the [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) section at the end of this document.

By installing the AEM Reference Demos Add-On, you automatically have We.Cafe content for AEM Screens available to you in your demo authoring environment. The steps described in the [Deploy a Demo Screens Project](#deploy-project) allow you to enable the full AEM Screens experience by publishing that content and deploying to media players etc.

## Understand the Demo Content {#demo-content}

The We.Cafe coffee shop is comprised of three shops in three locations in the US. All three shops have three similar experiences:

* A menu board above the counter with two or three vertical panels
* An entrance display facing the street with one horizontal or vertical panel inviting customers into the shop
* A quick self-order kiosk booth to bypass the queue with one vertical tablet

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only the entrance display can be tested in the current version of the demo. Other displays will follow in a future version.
>
>The kiosk is not included in the current version of the demo. It will be included in a future version.

The New-York location is assumed to be in a smaller shop that does not have a lot of space, and as such:

* The menu board only has two vertical panels instead of three for San Francisco and San Jose
* The entrance display is positioned vertically instead of horizontally

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you decide to connect to Screens Cloud Service in the [Connect Screens as a Cloud Service](#connect-screens) section, please create the locations as folders under displays. See the [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) section at the end of this document for more information on displays.

### Cafe Layouts {#care-layouts}

The We.Cafe locations have the following layouts.

![We.Cafe layouts](assets/cafe-layouts.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Measurements for the screens are in inches.

### Entrance {#entrance}

The entrance display is day-parted, and will just change the first image from morning to afternoon. On each pass of the sequence it will also advertise a different special coffee preparation, using a metered embedded sequence to play a different item each time.

The last image on the entrance channels is also targeted (i.e. dynamically changed) based on outside temperature, which can be simulated as described in the [Create Simulated Data Source](#data-source) section.

## Deploy a Demo Screens Project {#deploy-project}

In order to use the demo content in the sandbox you created in the [Create Program](create-program.md) step, a site must be created based on a template.

If you have not already created a We.Cafe demo site, simply follow the same steps as in the [Create Demo Site](create-site.md) section. When selecting the template, simply choose the **We.Cafe Website Template**.

![We.Cafe template](assets/wecafe-template.png)

Once the wizard completes, you will find the content deployed under Sites and you can navigate and explore as you would any other content.

![We.Cafe content](assets/wecafe-content.png)

Now that you have We.Cafe demo content, you have a choice about how you wish to test AEM Screens:

* If you only wish to explore the content within the AEM Sites console, simply start exploring and discover more in the [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) section! no more action is required.
* If you want to experience the full dynamic features of AEM Screens, continue to the next section, [Dynamically Change Screens Content.](#dynamically-change)

## Dynamically Change Screens Content {#dynamically-change}

Just like AEM Sites, AEM Screens can change content dynamically based on context. The We.Cafe demo has channels configured to show different content depending on the current temperature. To simulate this, we will need to create our own simple weather service.

### Create Simulated Data Source {#data-source}

Since it is very difficult to change the weather during a demo or while testing, temperature changes must be simulated. We will simulate a weather service by storing a temperature value in a Google Sheet spreadsheet which AEM's ContextHub will call to retrieve the temperature.

#### Create Google API Key {#create-api-key}

First we will need to create a Google API key to facilitate the exchange of data.

1. Log into a Google account.
1. Open up the Cloud Console using this link `https://console.cloud.google.com`.
1. Create a new project by clicking on the current project name in the top-left of the toolbar after the **Google Cloud Platform** label.

   ![Google Cloud Console](assets/google-cloud-console.png)

1. In the project selector dialog, click **NEW PROJECT**.

   ![New project](assets/new-project.png)

1. Give the project a name and click **CREATE**.

   ![Create project](assets/create-project.png)

1. Make sure your new project is selected and then using the hamburger menu in the dashboard of the Cloud Console, select **APIs &amp; Services**.

   ![APIs and Services](assets/apis-services.png)

1. In the left panel of the APIs &amp; Services window, click **Credentials** at the top of the window, then click **CREATE CREDENTIALS** and **API Key**.

   ![Credentials](assets/credentials.png)

1. In the dialog, copy your new API key and save for later use. Click **CLOSE** to close the dialog.

#### Enable Google Sheets API {#enable-sheets}

To allow the exchange of Google Sheets data using your API key, you need to enable the Google Sheets API.

1. Return to the Google Cloud Console at `https://console.cloud.google.com` for your project and then use the hamburger menu to select **APIs &amp; Services -&gt; Library**.

   ![API library](assets/api-library.png)

1. In the API Library screen, scroll to find our search for **Google Sheets API**. Click on it.

   ![API library search](assets/api-library-search.png)

1. In the **Google Sheets API** window click **ENABLE**.

   ![Google sheets API](assets/sheets-api.png)

#### Create Google Sheets Spreadsheet {#create-spreadsheet}

Now you can create a Google Sheets spreadsheet to store your weather data.

1. Go to `https://docs.google.com` and create a new Google Sheets spreadsheet.
1. Define the temperature by entering `32` in cell A2.
1. Share the document by clicking on **Share** at the top-right of the window and under **Get link** click **Change**.

   ![Share sheet](assets/share-sheet.png)

1. Copy the link for the next step.

   ![Share link](assets/share-link.png)

1. Locate the sheet ID.

   * The sheet ID is the random string of characters in the sheet link you copied after `d/` and before `/edit`.
   * For example:
     * If your URL is `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cNM7j1B52HgMdsjf8frCQrXpnypIb8NkJ98YcxqaEP30/edit#gid=0` 
     * The sheet ID is `1cNM7j1B52HgMdsjf8frCQrXpnypIb8NkJ98YcxqaEP30`.

1. Copy the sheet ID for future use.

#### Test Your Weather Service {#test-weather-service}

Now that you have created your data source as a Google Sheets spreadsheet and enable access via API, test it to ensure that your "weather service" is accessible.

1. Open a web browser.

1. Enter the following request, replacing the sheet ID and API key values that you saved previously.

   ```
   https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/<yourSheetID>/values/Sheet1?key=<yourAPIKey>
   ```

1. If you receive JSON data similar to the following, you set it up properly.

   ```json
   {
     "range": "Sheet1!A1:Z1000",
     "majorDimension": "ROWS",
     "values": [
       [],
       [
         "32"
       ]
     ]
   }
   ```

AEM Screens can use this same service to access the simulated weather data. This will be configured in the next step.

### Configure ContextHub {#configure-contexthub}

AEM Screens can change content dynamically based on context. The We.Cafe demo has channels configured to show different content depending on the current temperature by leveraging AEM's ContextHub.

>[!TIP]
>
>For the full details of ContextHub, see the [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) section at the end of this document.

When the screen content is displayed, ContextHub will call up your weather service to find the current temperature to determine what content to display.

For demo purposes, the values in the sheet can be changed. ContextHub will recognize this and the content will adjust in the channel according to the updated temperature.

1. On the AEMaaCS author instance, go to **Global Navigation -&gt; Tools -&gt; Sites -&gt; ContextHub**.
1. Select the configuration container that has the same name as what you gave the project when you created the Screens project from the **We.Cafe Website Template**.
1. Select **Configuration -&gt; ContextHub Configuration -&gt; Google Sheets** then click **Next** at the top right.
1. The configuration should already have pre-configured JSON data. There are two values that need to be changed:
   1. Replace `[your Google Sheets id]` with the sheet ID [you saved previously.](#create-spreadsheet)
   1. Replace `[your Google API Key]` with the API key [you saved previously.](#create-api-key)
1. Click **Save**.

Now you can change the temperature value in your Google Sheet spreadsheet and ContextHub will update Screens dynamically as it "sees the weather change."

### Test Dynamic Data {#test-dynamic}

Now that AEM Screens and ContextHub is connected to your weather service, you can test it to see how screens can update content dynamically.

1. Access your sandbox author instance.
1. Navigate to the sites console via **Global Navigation -&gt; Sites** and select the following page **Screens -&gt; &lt;project-name&gt; -&gt; Channels -&gt; Entrance Morning (Portrait)**.

   ![Select demo project content](assets/project-content.png)

1. Click Edit in the toolbar or type the shortcut key `e` to edit the page.

1. In the editor, you can see the content. Note that one image is high lighted in blue with a targeting icon in the corner.

   ![Screens content in editor](assets/screens-content-editor.png)

1. Change the temperature you entered in your spreadsheet from 32 to 70 and watch the content change.

   ![Screens content in editor](assets/screens-content-editor-2.png)

Based on the temperature changing from a freezing 32°F (0°C) to a comfortable 70°F (21°C), the featured image changed from a warming cup of tea to a cool iced coffee.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Only use the described Google Sheets solution for demo purposes. Adobe does not support using Google Sheets for production environments.

## Connect Screens as a Cloud Service {#connect-screens}

If you would like to also set up a real digital signage experience, including a player that runs on a digital signage device or on your computer, follow the next steps.

Alternatively you can preview the demo simply in the Channel Editor on AEMaaCS.
