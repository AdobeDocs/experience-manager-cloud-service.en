# Deploy Your Customized Theme {#deploy-your-customized-theme}

Learn how to deploy the site theme using the pipeline.

## The Story So Far {#story-so-far}

In the previous document of the AEM Quick Site Creation journey, [Customize the Site Theme,](customize-theme.md) you learned how the theme is built, how to customize it, and how to test it using live AEM content, and you should now:

* Understand the basic structure of the site theme and how to edit it.
* See how to test your theme customizations using real AEM content via local proxy.
* Know how to commit your changes to the AEM git repository.

You can now take the final step and use the pipeline to deploy them.

## Objective {#objective}

This document explains how to deploy the theme using the pipeline. After reading you should:

* Know how you can trigger a pipeline deployment.
* See how to check the deployment status.

## Responsible Role {#responsible-role}

This part of the journey applies to the front-end developer.

## Start the Pipeline {#start-pipeline}

Once you have committed the theme customization changes to the AEM git repository, you can run [the pipeline that the administrator  created](pipeline-setup.md) to deploy the changes.

1. Sign into Cloud Manager [as you did to retrieve your git access information](retrieve-access.md) And access your program. On the **Overview** tab you will see a card for **Pipelines**.

1. Tap or click the ellipsis next to the pipeline you need to start. From the drop-down menu, select **Run**.

   ![Run pipeline](assets/run-pipeline.png)

1. In the **Run Pipeline** confirmation dialog, tap or click **Yes**.

   ![Confirm pipeline run](assets/pipeline-confirm.png)

1. In the list of pipelines, the status column indicates that your pipeline is now running.

## Check Pipeline Status {#pipeline-status}

You can check the status of the pipeline to see the detail of its progress at any time.

1. Tap or click the ellipsis next to your pipeline.

   ![View pipeline details](assets/view-pipeline-details.png)

1. The pipeline detail window shows the breakdown of the pipeline's progress.

>[!TIP]
>
>In the pipeline details window, you can tap or click **Download Log** for any step of the pipeline for debugging purposes if any step should fail. Debugging the pipeline is beyond the scope of this journey. See the technical docs for Cloud Manager in the [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) section of this page.

## Validate the Deployed Customizations {#view-customizations}

Once the pipeline is complete, you can inform the administrator to validate the changes. The administrator will then:

1. Open the AEM authoring environment.
1. Navigate to [the site the administrator previously created.](create-site.md)
1. Edit one of the content pages.
1. See the changes applied.

## End of the Journey? {#end-of-journey}

Congratulations! You have completed the AEM Quick Site Creation journey! You should now:

* Understand how Cloud Manager and the front-end pipeline work to manage and deploy front-end customizations.
* Know how to create an AEM site based on a template and how to download the site theme.
* How to onboard a front-end developer so that they can access the AEM git repository.
* How to customize and test a theme using proxied AEM content and commit those changes to AEM git.
* How to deploy front-end customization using the pipeline.

You are now ready to customize the themes of your own AEM site. However before you before begin creating different work streams using multiple front-end pipelines, please review the document [Developing Sites with the Front-End Pipeline.](/help/implementing/developing/introduction/developing-with-front-end-pipelines.md) It will help you get the most out of your front-end development by:

* Maintaining a single source of truth.
* Maintaining a separation of concerns.

AEM is a powerful tool and there are many additional options available. Check out some of the additional resources available in the [Additional Resources section](#additional-resources) to learn more about the features you saw in this journey.
