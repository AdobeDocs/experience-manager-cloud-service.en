## The Story So Far {#story-so-far}

In the previous document of the AEM Quick Site Creation journey, [Understand Cloud Manager and the Quick Site Creation Workflow,](cloud-manager.md) you learned about Cloud Manager and how it ties together the new Quick Site Creation process and you should now:

* Understand how AEM Sites and the Cloud Manager work together to facilitate front end development
* See how the front end customization step is entirely decoupled from AEM and requires no AEM knowledge.

This article builds on those fundamentals so you can take the first configuration step and set up a front end pipeline, which you will use later in the journey to deploy your front end customizations.

## Objective {#objective}

This document helps you understand front end pipelines and how to create one to manage the deployment of your site's customized theme. After reading you should:

* Understand how to set up a front end pipeline in Cloud Manager.
* Know how to retrieve access credentials for your front end developer to be able to commit the customized code.

## What's Next {#what-is-next}

Now that you have completed this part of the AEM Quick Site Creation journey you should:

* Understand how to set up a front end pipeline in Cloud Manager.
* Know how to retrieve access credentials for your front end developer to be able to commit the customized code.

Build on this knowledge and continue your AEM Quick Site Creation journey by next reviewing the document [Create Site from Template,](create-site.md) where you will learn how to quickly create a new AEM site using a template.
