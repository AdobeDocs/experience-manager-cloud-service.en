## AEM Documentation Journeys {#documentation-journeys}

[A Documentation Journey](/help/journey-documentation/documentation-journeys.md) ties together many different and perhaps complicated topics and features by providing a narrative that helps the reader, who can be new to AEM, understand and solve a business problem from beginning to end, while assuming minimal prior topic or AEM knowledge.

Documentation Journeys are designed around best practices principles, informed by Adobe's latest research, proven implementation experience from Adobe consultants, and feedback from customer projects.

If you want to know how Adobe recommends how to solve business cases with AEM Sites, AEM Sites Journeys are where to start.

## Audiences {#audiences}

Sites Journeys are designed for varying personas, laying out the requirements, steps, and approach to implementing sites solutions from different perspectives.

An individual journey is defined for a specific persona or audience, but also defines additional personas with which the reader interacts.

Information in the journeys can of course be useful to multiple personas, but a journey is targeted to a specific persona and some information may be superfluous to certain roles.
