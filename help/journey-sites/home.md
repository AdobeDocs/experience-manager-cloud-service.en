# AEM Headless Journeys {#aem-headless-journeys}

Start here for an overview of the guided journeys available to understand AEM's powerful sites features.

## Introduction {#introduction}

INFORMATION ON HOW GREAT SITES ARE GOES HERE

## AEM Documentation Journeys {#documentation-journeys}

[A Documentation Journey](/help/journey-documentation/home.md) ties together many different and perhaps complicated topics and features by providing a narrative that helps the reader, who can be new to AEM, understand and solve a business problem from beginning to end, while assuming minimal prior topic or AEM knowledge.

Documentation Journeys are designed around best practices principles, informed by Adobe's latest research, proven implementation experience from Adobe consultants, and feedback from customer projects.

If you want to know how Adobe recommends how to solve business cases with AEM Sites, AEM Sites Journeys are where to start.

## Audiences {#audiences}

Sites Journeys are designed for multiple personas, laying out the requirements, steps, and approach to implementing headless solutions from different perspectives. A journey is defined for a specific persona, but also defines additional personas with which the reader interacts.

The following are the personas that interact in the Sites Journeys.

|Persona|Description|Role in Journey|
|---|---|---|
|Developer|Has experience developing WCM applications which deliver web experiences|The developer works with authors, admins, and architects to understand the data and build application that deliver that data.|

|Translation Specialist|Defines what content should be translated and manages those workflows|The Translation specialist works with the content architect to define initial organization of content and may work with the developer for any translation-specific requirements.|
