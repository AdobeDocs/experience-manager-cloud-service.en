# AEM Sites Translation Journey {#aem-sites-translation-journey}

Start here for a guided journey through translating your AEM Sites content using AEM's powerful translation tools.

## Introduction {#introduction}

AEM Sites is a powerful tool set for creating and managing digital experiences. Content authors can easily create digital experiences using the sites editor and organize the content using the sites console, all while being able to see the content live as it is delivered by AEM to your audiences across channels.

AEM offers equally powerful tools to translate your content allowing you to deliver it as quickly as possible to your audiences in other regions or locales. This documentation journey introduces you to the authoring tools so you understand how content is created and managed in AEM and then dives into what you need to know to manage your own translation project.

If you are already familiar with AEM Sites and your translation requirements, you may already have the foundational knowledge of this journey. If so, consider referring to our technical documentation linked under the [additional resources section below](#additional-resources).

## AEM Documentation Journeys {#documentation-journeys}

[A Documentation Journey](/help/journey-documentation/documentation-journeys.md) ties together many different, complicated topics and features by providing a narrative that helps the reader, who can be new to AEM, understand and solve a business problem from beginning to end, while assuming minimal prior topic or AEM knowledge.

Documentation Journeys are designed around best practices principles, informed by Adobe's latest research, proven implementation experience from Adobe consultants, and feedback from customer projects.

If you want to know how Adobe recommends how to solve sites business cases with AEM, AEM Sites Journeys are where to start.

## Audience {#audience}

This journey is designed for the translation specialist persona, often referred to as the Translation Project Manager or TPM. This journey lays out the requirements, steps, and approach to translate AEM Sites content. The journey may define additional personas with which the translation specialist must interact, but the point-of-view for the journey is that of the translation specialist.

This journey assumes the reader has experience translating content on a large CMS system, but assumes no knowledge of  AEM.

The following are the personas that interact in this journey.

|Persona|Description|Role in Journey|
|---|---|---|
|Translation Specialist|Defines what content should be translated and manages those workflows|Audience of this journey|
|Content Author|Creates and manage content that is delivered as sites|Content Authors create content that the translation specialist must translate.|
|Administrator|Manages the base setup and configuration of AEM|The translation specialist works with the administrator to make configuration changes needed for translation such as installing a translation connector.|
|Content Architect|Analyzes the requirements for the data that must be delivered as sites and defines the structure for this data|Translation specialists work with the content architect to define the organization of the content so it can be easily translated.|

Information in this journey can be useful to all personas, but some information may be superfluous to certain roles. Stay tuned for [forthcoming journeys covering additional roles](/help/journey-documentation/documentation-journeys.md#journeys).
