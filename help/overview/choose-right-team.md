Chances are that in your organization several departments own different aspects of the digital experience. Without governance, the stage is set for endless debate, infighting, and confusion.

Digital governance starts with figuring out who’s in charge of what and who’s doing which digitally focused job. You may need to do some strategic hiring to add needed skills. An even bigger challenge is driving a culture shift — building broad support for the new technology and helping people get used to new ways of doing things. A key part of that effort is creating a digital community, which lets people learn from and support each other.

For now, we’ll focus on putting the right people in the right jobs to help drive your Adobe Experience Manager deployment. For each core product — Experience Manager Sites and Experience Manager Assets — we’ve provided a list of roles you’ll need to fill, along with the skills, levels of expertise, and attributes that make people effective in the various roles.

Your assignment this week is to review both lists with your implementation team and make sure you have people with relevant qualifications in each role.

## **Key Roles for AEM Experience Manager Sites**

A winning crew team needs nine people in the right seats — just like your deployment team. Your success with Adobe Experience Manager Sites depends on the strength of your team members and how well they work together. Make sure you have these nine roles assigned
