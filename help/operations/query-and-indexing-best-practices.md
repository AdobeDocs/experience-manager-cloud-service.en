# Query and Indexing Best Practices {#query-and-indexing-best-practices}

In AEM as a Cloud Service, all operational aspects regarding indexing are automated. This allows developers to focus on creating efficient queries and their corresponding index definitions.

## When to Use Queries {#when-to-use-queries}

Queries are a way to access content, but are not the only possibility. In many situations, content in the repository can be accessed more effectively by other means. You should consider if queries are the best and most efficient way to access content for your use case.

### Repository and Taxonomy Design {#repository-and-taxonomy-design}

When designing the taxonomy of a repository, several factors need to be taken into account. These include access controls, localization, component and page property inheritance, and more.

While designing a taxonomy that addresses these concerns, it is also important to consider the "traversability" of the indexing design. In this context, the traversability is the ability of a taxonomy to allow content to be predictably accessed based on its path. This makes for a more efficient system that is easier to maintain than one that requires multiple queries to be executed.

Additionally, when designing a taxonomy, it is important to consider whether ordering is important. In cases where explicit ordering is not required and a large number of sibling nodes are expected, it is preferred to use an unordered node type such as `sling:Folder` or `oak:Unstructured`. In cases where ordering is required, `nt:unstructured` and `sling:OrderedFolder` would be more appropriate.

### Queries in Components {#queries-in-components}

Since queries can be one of the more taxing operations done on an AEM system, it is a good idea to avoid them in your components. Having several queries execute each time a page is rendered can often degrade the performance of the system. There are two strategies that can be used to avoid executing queries when rendering components: **[traversing nodes](#traversing-nodes)** and **[prefetching results.](#prefetching-results)**

### Traversing Nodes {#traversing-nodes}

If the repository is designed in such a way that allows prior knowledge of the location of the required data, code that retrieves this data from the necessary paths can be deployed without having to run queries in order to find it.

An example of this would be rendering content that fits within a certain category. One approach would be to organize the content with a category property that can be queried to populate a component that shows items in a category.

A better approach would be to structure this content in a taxonomy by category so that it can be manually retrieved.

For example, if the content is stored in a taxonomy similar to:

```xml
/content/myUnstructuredContent/parentCategory/childCategory/contentPiece
```

the `/content/myUnstructuredContent/parentCategory/childCategory` node can simply be retrieved, its children can be parsed and used to render the component.

Additionally, when you are dealing with a small or homogenous result set, it can be faster to traverse the repository and gather the required nodes, rather than crafting a query to return the same result set. As a general consideration, queries should be avoided where it is possible to do so.

### Prefetching Results {#prefetching-results}

Sometimes the content or the requirements around the component does not allow the use of node traversal as a method of retrieving the required data. In such cases, the required queries need to be executed before the component is rendered so that optimal performance is ensured.

If the results that are required for the component can be calculated at the time that it is authored and there is no expectancy that the content will change, the query can be executed after a change has been done.

If the data or content will change regularly, the query can be executed on a schedule or via a listener for updates to the underlying data. Then, the results can be written to a shared location in the repository. Any components that need this data can then pull the values from this single node without needing to execute a query at runtime.

A similar strategy can be used to keep the result in an in-memory cache, which is populated on startup and updated whenever changes are done (using a JCR `ObservationListener` or a Sling `ResourceChangeListener`).

## Optimizing Queries {#optimizing-queries}

The Oak documentation provides a [high-level overview how queries are executed.](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/query/query-engine.html#query-processing) This forms the basis of all optimization activities described in this document.

AEM as a Cloud Service provides the Query Performance Tool, which is designed to support implementing efficient queries.

* It displays already executed queries with their relevant performance characteristics and the query plan.
* It allows performing ad-hoc queries in various levels, starting from just displaying the query plan up to executing the full query.

The Query Performance Tool is reachable via the [Developer Console in Cloud Manager.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/debugging/debugging-aem-as-a-cloud-service/developer-console.html#queries) AEM as a Cloud Service's Query Performance Tool delivers more information about the details of the query execution over the AEM 6.x version.

This chart illustrates the general flow to use the Query Performance Tool to optimize queries.

### Use an Index {#use-an-index}

Every query should use an index to deliver optimal performance. In the majority of cases, existing out-of-the-box indexes should be sufficient to handle queries.

Sometimes custom properties need to be added to an existing index, so additional constraints can be queried using the index. See the document [Content Search and Indexing](/help/operations/indexing.md#changing-an-index) for more details. The [JCR Query Cheatsheet](#jcr-query-cheatsheet) section of this document describes how a property definition on an index has to look in order to support a specific query type.

### Use the Right Criteria {#use-the-right-criteria}

The primary constraint on any query should be a property match, as this is the most efficient type. Adding more property constraints limits the result further.

The query engine considers just a single index. That means that an existing index can and should be customized by adding more custom index properties to it.

The [JCR Query cheatsheet](#jcr-query-cheatsheet) section of this document lists the available constraints and also outlines how an index definition needs to look so it picked up. Use the [Query Performance Tool](#query-performance-tool) to test the query and to make sure that the right index is used and that the query engine does not need to evaluate constraints outside of the index. 

### Ordering {#ordering}

If a specific order of the result is requested, there are two ways for the query engine to achieve this:

1. The index can deliver the result completely and in the right order.
   * This works if the properties which are used for ordering are annotated with `ordered=true` in the index definition.
1. The query engine performs the ordering process.
   * This can occur when the query engine performs filtering outside of the index or the ordering property is not annotated with the `ordered=true` property.
   * This requires that the complete result set is read into memory for sorting, which is much slower than the first option.

### Restrict the Result Size {#restrict-result-size}

The retrieved size of the query result is an important factor in query performance. As the result is fetched in a lazy manner, there is a difference in just fetching the first 20 results compared to fetching 10,000 results, both in runtime and memory usage.

This also means that the size of the result set can only be determined correctly if all results are fetched. For this reason, the fetched result set should always be limited, either by augmenting the query (see the [JCR Query cheatsheet](#jcr-query-cheatsheet) section of this document for details) or by limiting the reads of the results.

Such a limit also prevents the query engine of hitting the **traversal limit** of 100,000 nodes, which leads to a forced stop of the query.

See the section [Queries with large results](#queries-with-large-result-sets) of this document if a potentially large result set must be processed completely.

## JCR Query Cheatsheet {#jcr-query-cheatsheet}

To support the creation of efficient JCR queries and index definitions, the [JCR Query Cheat Sheet](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/practices/best-practices-for-queries-and-indexing.html#jcrquerycheatsheet) is available for download and use as a reference during development.

It contains sample queries for QueryBuilder, XPath, and SQL-2, covering multiple scenarios which behave differently in terms of query performance. It also provides recommendations for how to build or customize Oak indexes. The content of this Cheat Sheet applies to AEM as a Cloud Service as well as AEM 6.5.

## Queries with Large Result Sets {#queries-with-large-result-sets}

Although it is recommended to avoid queries with large result sets, there are valid cases where large result sets must be processed. Often the size of result is not known up front, thus some precautions should be taken to make the processing reliable.

* The query should not be executed within a request. Instead the query should be executed as part of a Sling Job or an AEM workflow. These do not have any limitations in their total runtime, and are restarted in case the instance goes down during the processing of the query and its results.
* To overcome the query limit of 100,000 nodes, you should consider using [Keyset Pagination](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/query/query-engine.html#Keyset_Pagination) and split the query in multiple subqueries.

## Repository Traversal {#repository-traversal}

Queries traversing the repository do not use an index and are logging with a message similar to the following.

```text
28.06.2022 13:32:52.804 *WARN* [127.0.0.1 [1656415972414] POST /libs/settings/granite/operations/diagnosis/granite_queryperformance.explain.json HTTP/1.1] org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index.Cursors$TraversingCursor Traversed 98000 nodes with filter Filter(query=select [jcr:path], [jcr:score], * from [nt:base] as a /* xpath: //* */, path=*) called by com.adobe.granite.queries.impl.explain.query.ExplainQueryServlet.getHeuristics; consider creating an index or changing the query
```

With this log snippet you can determine:

* The query itself: `//*`
* The Java code which executed this query: `com.adobe.granite.queries.impl.explain.query.ExplainQueryServlet::getHeuristics` to help identify the creator of the query.

With this information, it is possible to optimize this query using the methods described in the [Optimizing Queries](#optimizing-queries) section of this document.
