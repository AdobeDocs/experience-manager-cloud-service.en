# Infrastructure and Service Monitoring in AEM as a Cloud Service {#monitoring-in-aem-as-a-cloud-service}

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service provides observability and monitoring of: infrastructure, services and user experience. Since a variety of solutions are used and there are several layers of monitoring, this page is organized into three sections:

* [External availability](external-availability)
* [Internal module monitoring](#module-monitoring)
* [Customer observability](#customer-observability)

AEM as a Cloud Service uses hundreds of cloud-native monitors to continually report the state of each environment (24/7) for 365 days a year. The monitor definitions are not static, they are continuously reviewed to improve the early detection capability. Additionally, Adobe has on-call procedures set up to respond to alerts.

If you require information about other types of monitoring like logging or monitoring through Cloud Manager please see the [Additional Resources](#resources) section.

## External Availability {#external-availability}

External availability is comprised of two parts: Service Edge and Custom Monitoring.

### Service Edge {#service-edge}

All of your AEM as a Cloud Service environments are monitored for availability. However, Service Edge Monitoring is set up only for production environments and the metrics are used to calculate the customer's SLA. It takes environment runtime and the AEM as a Cloud Service CDN into consideration. Service Edge Monitoring employs five distinct locations close to your chosen region and checks periodically for availability. A site's unavailability will trigger an alert and will engage Adobe's on-call support teams and processes.

### Custom Monitoring {#custom-monitoring}

With Custom monitoring, customers have the option to provide up to five distinct web property URLs prior to [going live](/help/journey-migration/go-live.md). These URLs should be valid and return an HTTP 200 response code. These monitors support customers who [bring their own CDN](/help/implementing/dispatcher/cdn.md#point-to-point-CDN) in front of the Adobe CDN  and any external traffic routing employed in front of AEM as a Cloud Service that is not under Adobeâ€™s control. Alerts resulting from Custom Monitoring checks will engage Adobe's support teams and processes.

## Internal Module Monitoring {#module-monitoring}

While external availability is focused on end-user monitoring, internal module monitoring observes whether the architectural sub-systems are operating nominally without feature or performance degradation. In case of a problem, alerts are triggered so repairs can be done either automatically or through the involvement of the operations team, with the goal of preventing compromised availability. There are various categories of monitors, presented below are some example checks:

* The CPU iowait percentage does not exceed a certain threshold.
* Instance redeployments do not exceed a certain frequency.
* Disk usage is below a certain threshold.
* Author repository size is within certain bounds.
* Backup operations are completed succesfully.
* Databases performance is as expected.
* AEM Cloud services are behaving as expected, including no blocked replication queues, consistent data and performant queries.

Additional checks are added to environments provisioned for Forms. Please keep in mind that check definitions are not static and are subject to changes and updates.

## Customer observability {#customer-observability}

Customers can use the [New Relic Application Performance Monitoring](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/user-access-new-relic.html) suite that provides real time performance data collected and charted for analysis and troubleshooting. By using the monitoring suite, customers can directly observe various metrics such as: JVM performance metrics, transaction time for Java, background external calls and database calls.
