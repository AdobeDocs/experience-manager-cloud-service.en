Maintenance Tasks are processes that run on a schedule to optimize the repository. With AEM as a Cloud Service, the need for customers to configure the operational properties of maintenance tasks is minimal. Customers can focus their resources on application-level concerns, leaving the infrastructure operations to Adobe.

## Configuring maintenance tasks {#maintenance-tasks-configuring}

In previous versions of AEM, you could configure maintenance tasks by using the Maintenance Card (Tools > Operations > Maintenance). For AEM as a Cloud Service, the Maintenance Card is no longer available so configurations should be committed to source control and deployed by using the Cloud Manager. Adobe manages those maintenance tasks which have settings that are not configurable by customers (for example, Datastore Garbage Collection). Other maintenance tasks can be configured by customers, as described in the table below.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Adobe reserves the right to override a customer's maintenance task configuration settings to mitigate issues such as performance degradation.

The following table illustrates the maintenance tasks that are available at the time of release of AEM as a Cloud Service.
