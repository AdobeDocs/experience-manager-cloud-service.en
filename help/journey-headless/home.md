# AEM Headless Journeys {#aem-headless-journeys}

Start here for an overview of the guided journeys available to understand AEM's powerful headless features.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Headless implementation is increasingly becoming important for delivering experiences to your audience, wherever they are and regardless of channel.

Headless implementation forgoes page and component management as is traditional in full stack solutions and focuses on the creation of channel-neutral, reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery. It is a modern and dynamic development pattern for implementing digital experiences.

If you are new to AEM and/or headless, AEM's Headless Journeys are a great place to start to understand the theory and technology by way of a narrative to solve various business problems in a headless fashion.

## AEM Documentation Journeys {#documentation-journeys}

[A Documentation Journey](/help/journey-documentation/home.md) ties together many different and perhaps complicated topics and features by providing a narrative that helps the reader, who can be new to AEM, understand and solve a business problem from beginning to end, while assuming minimal prior topic or AEM knowledge.

Documentation Journeys are designed around best practices principles, informed by Adobe's latest research, proven implementation experience from Adobe consultants, and feedback from customer projects.

If you want to know how Adobe recommends how to solve headless business cases with AEM, AEM Headless Journeys are where to start.

## Audiences {#audiences}

Headless Journeys are designed for multiple personas, laying out the requirements, steps, and approach to implementing headless solutions from different perspectives. A journey is defined for a specific persona, but also defines additional personas with which the reader interacts.

The following are the personas that interact in the Headless Journeys.

|Persona|Description|Role in Journey|
|---|---|---|
|Developer|Has experience developing headless applications which consume content from different sources|The developer works with authors, admins, and architects to understand the data and build a headless application that consumes that data.|
|Content Author|Creates and manages content that is delivered headlessly|Content Authors create content that the developer delivers headlessly.|
|Administrator|Manages the base setup and configuration of AEM|The developer works with the administrator to make configuration changes needed for development.|
|Content Architect|Analyzes the requirements for the data that must be delivered headlessly and defines the structure for this data|Developers work with the content architect to understand the structure of the data and requirements for delivering it headlessly.|
|Translation Specialist|Defines what content should be translated and manages those workflows|The Translation specialist works with the content architect to define initial organization of content and may work with the developer for any translation-specific requirements.|

Information in these journeys can of course be useful to all personas, but some information may be superfluous to certain roles.
