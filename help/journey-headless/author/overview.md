# AEM Headless Content Author Journey {#aem-headless-author-journey}

Start here for a guided journey through the powerful and flexible headless features of AEM, their capabilities, and how to author content for your headless project.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Headless implementation is increasingly becoming important for delivering experiences to your audience, wherever they are and regardless of channel.

Headless content is not based on the traditional structure of pages, and components. Instead it is based on the creation of channel-neutral, reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery. 

In AEM this is realized with Content Fragments. You author the content in individual Content Fragments, that are then made available for an application to select and use as required. 

This flexibility means that headless is a modern and dynamic development pattern for implementing digital experiences.

This guide leads you through the most important topics so that on completion you:

* Have a basic understanding of what headless content delivery is and its benefits.
* Understand AEM's headless features and how they work together to deliver a headless experience.
* Have the ability to author content for your AEM headless project.

## Audience {#audience}

This journey is designed for the content author persona, laying out the requirements, steps, and approach for authoring content for an AEM Headless project. The journey will define additional personas with which the author must interact for a successful project, but the point-of-view for the journey is that of the content author.

Information in this journey can of course be useful to other personas, but some information will be superfluous to certain roles. Stay tuned for forthcoming journeys covering additional roles.

## The Headless Content Author Journey {#the-journey}

You will explore many topics in this journey. The following articles give you foundational knowledge of headless in AEM and link out to detailed technical documentation.

Although you can go directly to a particular part of the journey, many concepts build on ones in previous articles. Therefore if you are new to headless in AEM, we recommend that you start at the beginning and progress sequentially.
