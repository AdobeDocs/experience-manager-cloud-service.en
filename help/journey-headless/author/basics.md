# Authoring Basics for Headless with AEM {#author-headless-basics}

<!-- screenshots to be added later -->

## The Story so Far {#story-so-far}

At the beginning of the [AEM Headless Content Author Journey](overview.md) the [Introduction](introduction.md) covered the basic concepts and terminology relevant to authoring for headless.

This article builds on these so you understand how to author your own content for your AEM headless project.

## Objective {#objective}

* **Audience**: Beginner
* **Objective**: Introduce the basics of Headless CMS Authoring:
  * Introduction to authoring with AEMaaCS
  * Introduction to Content Fragments

## Basic Handling {#basic-handling}

Before you get to grips with Content Fragments, here is a quick introduction to using AEM.

### Author and Publish {#author-preview-publish}

An AEM installation generally consists of at least two environments:

* Author
* Publish

You log into, and use the author environment to generate your content. When ready you then publish your content so that it becomes generally available. For headless this would be to other applications, for web pages this would be to readers on the web.

For more details see the Authoring Concepts.

### Signing In {#signing-in}

As with most systems you will need to login. As an author you will be provided with:

* User (account) name
* Password
* Link to access the login screen

Your account will have been configured with any privileges that you need. If you have any issues, we recommend that you contact your in-house project support team.

### Navigation {#navigation}

The first time you log in a small online tutorial will highlight some of the main features of the user interface.

You can then use the Navigation Panel to access key areas of AEM. For Content Fragments you will be using the **Assets Console**. 

>[!NOTE]
>Although Content Fragments are a feature of AEM **Sites**, they are found in the **Assets** console. This is a technical detail that should not affect you, but might be useful to know.

Within the console you can select folders to navigate to your Content Fragment, or the breadcrumbs (in the header) to navigate back up the tree.

### Actions, Selecting, Viewing {#actions-selecting-viewing}

The **Assets** console has dedicated **Action Toolbars**, and **Quick Actions** that you can use after selecting a resource (for example, a folder or content fragment).

You can view additional information about items using the Rail Selector. This also gives access to additional actions.

### Headless vs "Traditional" use of Content Fragments {#headless-vs-traditional}

## What's Next {#whats-next}

Now that you have learned the basics, the next step is to [Learn how about References](references.md). This will introduce and discuss the various references available, and how to create levels of structure with the Fragment References.
