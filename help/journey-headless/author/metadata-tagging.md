# Learn about defining Metadata and Tagging for Content Fragments {#author-headless-metadata-tagging}

## The Story so Far {#story-so-far}

At the beginning of the [AEM Headless Content Author Journey](overview.md) the [Introduction](introduction.md) covered the basic concepts and terminology relevant to authoring for headless.

In the previous step you were introduced to the use of references for Headless CMS Authoring. You learned what sorts of references are available, and what are their purposes: Content References, Asset/Media References, and Fragment References.

This article builds on these so you understand how to use metadata and tagging to author your own content for your AEM headless project.
