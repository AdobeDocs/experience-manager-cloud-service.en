# Learn about Creating Content Fragment Models in AEM {#architect-headless-content-fragment-models}

## The Story so Far {#story-so-far}

At the beginning of the [AEM Headless Content Author Journey](overview.md) the [Content Modeling Basics for Headless with AEM](basics.md) covered the basic concepts and terminology relevant to authoring for headless.

This article builds on these so you understand how to create your own Content Fragment Modelsfor your AEM headless project.

## Enabling Content Fragment Models {#enabling-content-fragment-models}

At the very start you need to enable Content Fragment Models for your site, this is done in the Configuration Browser; under Tools -> General -> Configuration Browser. You can either select to configure the global entry, or create a new configuration. For example:

![Define configuration](/help/assets/content-fragments/assets/cfm-conf-01.png)

Then the Content Fragments Models can be created and the structure defined. This can be done under Tools -> Assets -> Content Fragment Models.

After selecting this you navigate to the location for your model and select **Create**. Here you can enter various key details.

The option **Enable model** is activated by default. This means that your model will be available for use (in creating Content Fragments) as soon as you have saved it. You can deactivate this if you want - there are opportunities later to enable (or disable) an existing model.

Confirm with **Create** and you can then **Open** your model to start defining the structure.
