# AEM Headless Content Architect Journey {#aem-headless-content-architect-journey}

Start here for a guided journey through the powerful and flexible headless features of AEM, their capabilities, and how to leverage them on your first headless project.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Headless implementation is increasingly becoming important for delivering experiences to your audience, wherever they are and regardless of channel.

Headless implementation forgoes page and component management as is traditional in full stack solutions and focuses on the creation of channel-neutral, reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery. It is a modern and dynamic development pattern for implementing digital experiences.

This guide leads you through the most important topics so that on completion you:

* Understand what headless content delivery is and its benefits.
* Understand how to model your content for AEM's headless features.
* Have the ability to take the first steps modeling your content for your first AEM headless project.

## Audience {#audience}

This journey is designed for the Content Architect persona. As a Content Architect you will be defining the structure of the content. These definitions will then be used by the Content Authors, when they create the actual content.

The journey lays out the requirements, steps, and approach of an AEM Headless project from the perspective of a Content Architect. The journey will define additional personas with which the content architect must interact for a successful project, but the point-of-view for the journey is that of the content architect.

Information in this journey can of course be useful to other personas, but some information will be superfluous to certain roles. Stay tuned for forthcoming journeys covering additional roles.

## The Headless Content Architect Journey {#the-journey}

You will explore many topics in this journey. The following articles give you foundational knowledge of headless in AEM and link out to detailed technical documentation.

Although you can go directly to a particular part of the journey, many concepts build on ones in previous articles. Therefore if you are new to headless in AEM, we recommend that you start at the beginning and progress sequentially.
