## Introduction {#introduction}

The Headless implementation of AEM uses Content Fragments Models and Content Fragments to focus on the creation of structured, channel-neutral, and reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery. To achieve this it forgoes page and component management as is traditional in full stack solutions. It is a modern and dynamic development pattern for implementing digital experiences.

This guide leads you through headless implementation topics in AEM so when you are done you will:

* Have a full understanding of what headless content delivery is and its benefits.
* Understand AEM's headless features and how they work together to deliver a headless experience.
* Have the ability to take the first steps implementing your first AEM headless project.

> If you prefer to **learn by doing** and have existing knowledge of AEM, visit the AEM Headless tutorials, which are organized by API and framework and are available in the [Additional Resources section](#additional-resources) at the end of this document.

## Audience {#audience}

This journey is designed for the developer persona, laying out the requirements, steps, and approach of an AEM Headless project from a developer's perspective. The journey defines additional personas with which the developer must interact for a successful project, but the point-of-view for the journey is that of the developer.

The following are the personas that interact in this journey.
