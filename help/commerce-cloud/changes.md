# Notable changes to Commerce on AEM as a Cloud Service {#notable-changes}

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service brings many new features and possibilities to manage your AEM projects. This document highlights the important differences for Commerce capabilities between Commerce Integration Framework (CIF) for on-premise, Adobe Managed Service and Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. For other changes, see the generic [changes to Experience Manager as a Cloud Service](/help/release-notes/aem-cloud-changes.md).

The main differences as compared to Experience Manager 6.5 are in the following areas:
* [Support for CIF Classic](#cif-classic)
* [Deployment of CIF Authoring Tools](#cif-tools)

## Support for CIF Classic on Experience Manager as a Cloud Service {#cif-classic}
The Classic Commerce Integration Framework which included a Product Importer to import and store product catalogs in Experience Manager is no longer available in Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. The use of Classic CIF is not supported in Experience Manager as a Cloud Service and projects using Classic CIF will have to replace the Classic CIF implementation with the supported version as described in [CIF on Experience Manager as a Cloud Service](#commerce-architecture)


## Deployment of CIF Authoring Tools {#cif-tools}
