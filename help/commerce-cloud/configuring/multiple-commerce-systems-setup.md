# Setup multiple commerce systems

The single Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) CIF system can be used to connect to multiple Adobe or third-party commerce systems to support advanced deployments. This is useful in cases of multi-region, multi-brand storefronts wherein the single experience management layer simplifies the commerce content creation and delivery process. This also helps organizations to accelerate time to value (TTV) and decreases the total cost of ownership (TCO).

A video walkthrough detailing how to set up AEM with multiple Adobe commerce environments. The AEM Multi-Site Management (MSM) includes features like Live Copy and Language Copy. These features are used with the Commerce Integration Framework (CIF) to create a multi-region storefront wherein __EU region storefronts__ connect to __EU Adobe Commerce__ and __North American (NA) region storefront__ connect to __NA Adobe Commerce__ system.
