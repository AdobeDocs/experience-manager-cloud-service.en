# Getting started with AEM Commerce as a Cloud Service {#start}

To get started with AEM Commerce as a Cloud Service, your Experience Manager Cloud Service needs to be provisioned with the Commerce Integration Framework (CIF) add-on. You will need to provide information such as `imsOrgId`, `COMMERCE_ENDPOINT`, etc. as part of the provisioning process. For more details on pricing and provisioning, you need to reach out to your sales representative.

Once you have been provisioned with the CIF add-on, it will be applied to any existing Cloud Manager programs. In case, you don't have a Cloud Manager Program, you will need to create a new one. For more details, refer to [Setup your Program](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/getting-started/setting-up-program.html). There are some additional configurations you will need to do after you've been provisioned with the CIF add-on as described below.
