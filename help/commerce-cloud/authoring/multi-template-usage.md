# Creating Multiple Category and Product Pages {#multiple}

>[!NOTE]
>
> This functionality works only for storefronts based on CIF (for example, Venia).

[AEM CIF Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components) provides content authors the ability to create additional category and product pages. These pages can be enriched with additional marketing content and configured to target specific categories and products. The following video walks through the setup of this feature.

Specific product pages can be selected either by a sku or by a product's category. The later is only supported by some of the available default product page URL formats, as it requires category information to be encoded in the product url.

You can find more information on this topic from the following resource(s):
