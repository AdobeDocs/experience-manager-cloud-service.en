## The Story So Far {#story-so-far}

## Objective {#objective}

This document helps you understand how to manage product catalog pages and templates.

## The basic concept

Venia storefront comes with a typical product catalog experience with navigation, and landing, category (PLP), & product detail pages (PDP).

The navigation component shows content and catalog pages. It is possible to show either the catalog landing page or the first level categories in the navigation. Hovering over a category will show second level categories as a 2nd line.

Clicking on a category will open the category page (or product list page).

Catalog pages are built dynamically using an AEM CIF catalog template. Real-time product data is requested from the commerce backend whenever needed.
