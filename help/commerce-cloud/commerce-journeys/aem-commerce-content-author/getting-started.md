# Getting Started with AEM CIF Authoring {#getting-started}

Get to know about AEM CIF Authoring

## The Story So Far {#story-so-far}

In the previous document of this AEM Content and Commerce journey, [Learn about AEM Content and Commerce](/help/commerce-cloud/introduction.md), you learned the basic theory of what a headless CMS is and you should now understand the basic concepts of AEM Content and Commerce.

This article builds on those fundamentals.

## Objective {#objective}

This document helps you understand how to use CIF for Content and Commerce specific authoring. After reading you should:

* Understand the concepts of CIF authoring using the Universal Editor
* How to access product catalog data in AEM using product and cateogry pickers
* How to access content and commerce data using the product cockpit and AEM Omnisearch

## CIF Authoring in the Universal Editor

CIF extends the Universal Editor with capabilities to access the real-time product data without leaving the context:

### Using product data in the side panel

Open the side panel and select 'Products' from the dropdown.

You can  browse the product catalog or use the full-text search field to find products.

Products can be droppen on components that support product drops (example product teaser, product carousel) on directly on the page which automatically creates a product teaser component.

### Product & Category pickers

If product and category data is required in commerce components or AEM back-office dialogs, AEM authors can use pickers which are UI elements to comfortably search and select product catalog data.

**Product picker**
Clicking on the folder icon will open picker modal UI (Example product teaser)

Products can be found either by browsing through the catalog structure on the left or search. Full-text search will respect the selected category and limit the search results to this category.

Products with variations are marked with a folder icon that can be clicked to show all variations.
