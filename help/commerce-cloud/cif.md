# Introducing AEM Commerce Integration Framework (CIF) {#cif-intro}

Content and commerce projects are complex projects due to the nature of their requirements:

* Integration of a complex and dynamic ecosystem (example product catalogs)
* Business needs to manage product content with its own lifecycle in an efficient and omnichannel way
* Building complex and personalized shopping journeys
* Ability to quickly adapt and innovate on the back- and front-end
* Running a scaleable and stable E2E infrastructure that is built for peak performance (Flash sale, Black Friday, ...). This includes unified search and cache management.
