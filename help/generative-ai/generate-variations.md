# Generate Variations {#generate-variations}

If you are looking for a way to optimize your digital channels and accelerate content creation, you can use Generate Variations. Generate Variations uses generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create content variations based on prompts; these prompts are either provided by Adobe or created, and managed, by users. After creating variations, you can also measure their success using the [Experimentation](https://www.aem.live/docs/experimentation) functionality of [Edge Delivery Services](/help/edge/overview.md).

You can access Generate Variations from:

* within Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service
* the Sidekick of Edge Delivery Services
* directly

You can then:

* [Get started](#get-started) using a prompt template that Adobe has created for a specific use case.
* You can [edit an existing prompt](#edit-the-prompt)
* Or [create and use your own prompts](#create-prompt):
  * [Save your prompts](#save-prompt) for future use
  * [Access and use shared prompts](#select-prompt) from across your organization
* Define the [audience](#audiences) segments to use in the prompt when [generating personalized audience-specific content](#generate-copy).
* Preview the output alongside the prompt, before making amendments and refining the results if required.
* Leverage [Adobe Express to generate images](#generate-image) based on the copy variations; this uses the Generative AI capabilities of Firefly.
* Select content that you want to use in an experiment or use on your website.
