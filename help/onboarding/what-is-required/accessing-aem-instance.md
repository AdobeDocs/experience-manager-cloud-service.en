# Grant User Access to an AEM Instance {#accessing-aem-instance}

As a System Administrator, follow the steps below to grant user access to an AEM instance:

1. Navigate to Cloud Manager and click on the **Manage Access** button from the **Environments** card as shown below.

   >[!NOTE]
   >You must be a System Administrator or the user who created the environment in order to be able to add a user in the Admin Console. Only Business Owner or Deployment Manager roles have permissions to create an environment. Refer to [Cloud Manager Roles](/help/onboarding/what-is-required/user-roles-permissions.md) to learn more about roles and associated permissions. Additionally, refer to [Managing Environments](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/manage-environments.md) to learn about environments.
