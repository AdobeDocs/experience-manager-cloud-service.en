      >[!NOTE]
      >Refer to the preceding sections, [User Roles and Permissions](#user-roles) and [Permissions associated with Role Definitions](#permissions) to ensure that the right users are assigned the right Role(s) in the **Admin Console**.

      Now, you have added users to Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service Product Context and are setup with the right Roles or Product Profiles.

      For example, if you are in the role of a:

      * ***Business Owner***, you have the permission to Add a new program or Edit a program, add or update an environment, add/edit/delete the pipeline and run any pipeline, and deploy code to AEM environment or code quality.

      * ***Deployment Manager***, you have the permission to add or update an environment, run any pipeline, and deploy code to AEM environment or code-quality. 

      * ***Developer***, you have the permission to generate Personal Access Token to access Git.

        >[!NOTE]
        > A user can be assigned to multiple roles. For example assigning both Business Owner and Deployment Manager roles to a user gives them the combination or sum of these permissions.
