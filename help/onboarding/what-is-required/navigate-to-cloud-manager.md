# Navigate to Cloud Manager {#cloud-manager}

Cloud Manager is an important part of AEM as a Cloud Service. It enables organizations to self-manage Experience Manager in the cloud. It includes a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) framework that lets IT teams and implementation partners expedite the delivery of customizations or updates without compromising performance or security. Using the user interface, you can configure and kick off the CI/CD pipeline.

Once your System Administrator grants you access to Cloud Manager, you will receive an email that will take you to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com) Home page.

>[!NOTE]
>You must be added as a user and must be assigned at least to one Cloud Manager Role (Product Profile in Admin Console) by your System Administrator. 

1. From your welcome email click on **Get started**, as shown in the figure below.

   >[!NOTE]
   >Alternatively, you can also navigate directly to Cloud Manager login page from [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/). Depending on the roles assigned in [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] and the state of the application, you will see different screens while using [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] UI. Refer to the section below, [Cloud Manager Landing page](#cloud-manager-landing) for more details.

1. Select **Experience Manager**.

Upon successful login, you will be directed to the landing page of Cloud Manager.

You will see one of the three options, described below:

* **When No Programs exist in Cloud Manager**

   If no programs exist in your Organization, then your landing page directs you to create your first program, as shown in the figure below.

* **When Programs already exist in Cloud Manager**

   If program(s) already exist in your Organization, then your landing page directs you to add another program and displays all your existing programs too, as shown in the figure below.

* **When a Program exists and user is System Administrator**

   If program(s) already exist in your Organization, and you are a System Administrator, then your landing page displays **Manage Access** button along with **Add Program** option, as shown in the figure below.

From here, a user with the right permissions, such as a Business Owner role in Cloud Manager is able to select **Add Program** to launch the [Add Program wizard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/getting-access/production-programs/creating-production-program.html?lang=en#getting-access).
