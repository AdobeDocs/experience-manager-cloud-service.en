# Get your Adobe ID {#adobe-id}

This guide will provide you with a checklist to get you and your team started with Cloud Manager expeditiously. You will need your Adobe ID, and your System Administrator's help to add users to Cloud Manager to their assigned Roles,  referred to as Product Profiles in Admin Console and associated permissions. Refer to [System Administrator Tasks](/help/onboarding/what-is-required/add-users-assign-cm-roles.md) to learn how the System Administrator can do this via Admin Console.

>[!NOTE]
>The list of Cloud Manager Roles, referred to as Product Profiles in Admin Console and their associated permissions is detailed so you can determine what roles may be necessary for various users in your organization.

You must have an Adobe ID. Users of Cloud Service have to use their Adobe IDs to access the author tier. It has now been integrated with Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) and now provides a single-sign-on feature. Please visit [Manage Adobe Identity Types](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/identity.ug.html) for detailed instructions on how to obtain an Adobe ID using one of the identity types available.
