# Get your Adobe ID {#adobe-id}


You must have an Adobe ID. Users of Cloud Service have to use their Adobe IDs to access the author tier. It has now been integrated with Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) and now provides a single-sign-on feature. Please visit [Manage Adobe Identity Types](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/identity.ug.html) for detailed instructions on how to obtain an Adobe ID using one of the identity types available.

Adobe will create an Organization identifier for your company in the Adobe Identity Management System (IMS). Each user, who needs to be a member of this organization and will be granted access to any of the Experience Cloud solutions, will need to have their own Adobe ID.
