# Get your Adobe ID {#adobe-id}


You must have an Adobe ID. Users of Cloud Service have to use their Adobe IDs to access the author tier. It has now been integrated with Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) and now provides a single-sign-on feature. 

Please visit [Manage Adobe Identity Types](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/identity.ug.html) for detailed instructions on how to obtain an Adobe ID using one of the identity types available.
