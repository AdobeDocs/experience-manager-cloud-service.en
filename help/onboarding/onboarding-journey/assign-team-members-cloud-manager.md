# Assign Team Members to Cloud Manager Product Profiles {#assign-team-members}

Once you have learnt how to login to [Admin Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/onboarding-concepts/admin-console.html?lang=en) and viewed your privileges as a [System Administrator](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/onboarding-concepts/system-administrator.html?lang=en), you are now ready to assign team members to Cloud Manager Product profiles.

## Objective {#objective}

This document summarizes how to assign team members to Cloud Manager product profiles from the Adobe Admin Console. 

After reading this section you should be able to:

* Understand why and how you must add team members.
* Learn about three different Cloud Manager product profiles such as Business Owner, Deployment Manager, and Developer.
* Assign team members to Cloud Manager product profiles such as Business Owner, Deployment Manager, and Developer.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The following prerequisites should be considered before starting this section. You must:

* Be a System Administrator and understand [Cloud Manager Product Profiles](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/onboarding-concepts/aem-cs-team-product-profiles.html?lang=en#cloud-manager-product-profiles).
* Understand [Adobe Admin Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/onboarding-concepts/admin-console.html?lang=en) basics. 
* Have details about your team members. A System Administrator must have the names and email addresses and the roles and responsibilities for the team members who will need access to AEM as a Cloud Service. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >For the purpose of onboarding, we recommend that you initially add users who will participate in the immediate tasks, such as administrators, developers and content authors. You can continue the rest of the onboarding without adding all users. After you have finished onboarding, you can scale to a larger number of users later.

## Review Cloud Manager Product Profiles {#review-product-profiles}

From the Adobe Admin Console you can see the list of Cloud Manager Profiles.

Follow the steps below to view list of Cloud Manager Profiles:

## Assign Users to Business Owner Product Profile {#assign-users-business-owner}

You are now ready to add users and assign them to Cloud Manager Business Owner product profile.

>[!NOTE]
>In order to successfully do this, from Adobe Admin console you must add a user to both the product (AEM as a Cloud Service in this case), and [Cloud Manager Business Owner product profile](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/onboarding-concepts/aem-cs-team-product-profiles.html?lang=en#cloud-manager-product-profiles).

The following steps will walk you through this:

1. Identify the user(s) who will manage Cloud Manager Programs and add them to the Business Owner product profile. The System Administrator must be the first person to access and log in to Cloud Manager. You must add yourself (System Administrator) to the Business Owner product profile first. 

1. In [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/enterprise/overview) **Overview** page, select **Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service** product from **Products and services** card as shown below.

## What’s Next {#whats-next}

Now that you learnt about three different Cloud Manager product profiles such as Business Owner, Deployment Manager, and Developer and assigned team members to Cloud Manager product profiles such as Business Owner, Deployment Manager, and Developer, you should continue your onboarding journey by next reviewing the document Setup Cloud Resources via Cloud Manager, where you will learn:

1. As a System Administrator assigned to the *Business Owner* role, you must access and login to Cloud Manager. 

1. Next, a Cloud Manager user in the *Business Owner* role can login and setup your cloud resources including your cloud Program and Environments. This will ensure that your team of experts can begin accessing AEM as a Cloud Service as soon as possible.

1. After your *Business Owner* has setup your cloud resources, *Developers* and *Deployment Managers* who have been successfully added to the Cloud Manager product profiles can access Cloud Manager and familiarize themselves on how they can continue on their learning path.
