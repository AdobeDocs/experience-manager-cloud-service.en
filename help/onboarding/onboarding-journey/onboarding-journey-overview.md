## Audience {#audience}

Onboarding is the process during which a designated [System Administrator](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/onboarding-concepts/system-administrator.html?lang=en) sets up AEM as a Cloud Service for your organization. This includes the initial provisioning of cloud resources and assignment of users to appropriate roles based on their job responsibilities following which each member is able to login and access their AEM as a Cloud Service resources.

The onboarding journey is illustrated below and each step in the journey is described in detail in the following sections.
