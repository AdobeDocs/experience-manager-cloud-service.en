## What’s Next {#whats-next}

>[!NOTE]
>To be granted access to AEM as a Cloud Service users must belong to one of two product profiles `AEM Users` or `AEM Administrators`. See [Managing Products and User Access in Admin Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/security/ims-support.html?lang=en#managing-products-and-user-access-in-admin-console) to learn more.
