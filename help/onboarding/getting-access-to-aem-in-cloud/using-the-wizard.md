# Using Wizard to Create an AEM Application Project {#using-wizard-to-create-an-aem-application-project}

To help get new customers started, Cloud Manger is now able to create a minimal AEM project as a starting point. This process is based on the [**AEM Project Archetype**](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype).


Follow the steps below to create an AEM application project in Cloud Manager:

1. Once you log in to Cloud Manager and the basic program setup is complete, a special call to action card will be shown on the **Overview** screen, if the repository is empty.
