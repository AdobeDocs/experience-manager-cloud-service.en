# Create a Program {#create-a-program}

The cloud-native solution provides the user with requisite permissions and the ability to create a program on a self-service model.

A program creation wizard will ask the user to submit details, depending on the user’s objective in creating the program within the bounds of what is available to the specific customer or organization.

In the event of first-time access to Cloud Manager or if no programs exist in the tenant, the user will see **Create your first Program** screen. If user select *Esc* or clicks out of the dialog box, the following screen displays:

The steps below describe how to create a program intended for production:

1. Select **Set up for Production** in the Create Program wizard to create a regular program. User can accept the default program name or edit it before selecting **Continue**.
