# Editing a Sandbox Program {#create-sandbox-program}

Users with requisite permission can now edit a Production program, allowing them to do the following in a self-service manner:

* Add Sites solution to an existing program with Assets (or vice-versa).
* Remove Sites (or Assets) from an existing program with both Sites and Assets.
* Add second, unused solution entitlement either to an existing program or as a new Program.

   >[!NOTE]
   >A user in the Business Owner role must be logged in to successfully edit the program.

Follow the steps below to edit a Sandbox program:

1. Navigate to the **Edit Program** page from the Cloud Manager's *Overview* page.

1. The **Edit Program** page displays three options (**Sites**, **Commerce**, and **Assets**) for both Production and Sandbox programs.

## Considerations while Editing a Program {#considerations-editing}

Few considerations should be reviewed while editing a program:

* At least one solution must be selected for a Program that is, use will not be allowed to deselect all solutions during Edit program workflow. 

* Clicking the **Save** button, if the selected solutions have changed, solution updates to environments will take effect following the next deployment.
