# Navigation {#navigation} 

AEM is a cloud-native solution available as an innovative Cloud Service. 

Once your System Administrator grants you access to Cloud Manager, you will receive an email that will take you to Cloud Manager landing page which is also accessible through [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/). 

This will take you to the Cloud Manager login page.

## For Existing AMS Customers {#existing-aem}

If you are an existing AMS (Adobe Managed Services) customer and you have access to Cloud Service, you will see your existing program and can add programs to your Cloud Services.

Refer to [Adding Cloud Services Program](/help/onboarding/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/first-time-login.md#existing-program) for more details.

## For New Cloud Services Customers {#new-cloud-services}

If you are a new Cloud Service customer, then you will want to add a new program to your Cloud Service.
