# Navigation {#navigation} 

AEM is a cloud-native solution available as an innovative Cloud Service. 

Once your System Administrator grants you access to Cloud Manager, you will receive an email that will take you to Cloud Manager landing page which is also accessible through [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/). 

This will take you to the Cloud Manager login page.  Upon successful login, you will be directed to the landing page of Cloud Manager.
