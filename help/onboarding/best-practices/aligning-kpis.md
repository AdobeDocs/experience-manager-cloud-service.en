In a digital world, you can measure almost everything. Choosing three KPIs for your Adobe Experience Manager implementation will help your team focus on what matters most.


## **Follow these 6 steps to decide what to measure and how**


1.  **Start with your business objectives.** For example, your business objectives might be to grow online revenue, decrease operational expenses, or reduce legal expenses associated with digital rights management (DRM) violations.
    
1.  **Based on your objectives, determine your goals.** Your goals are the specific outcomes you hope to achieve by adopting Experience Manager as your content management platform. If your objective is to grow online revenue, your goal might be to achieve a 2-point increase in conversion for all pages with marketing content. If your objective is to decrease operational expenses, your goal might be to improve the productivity of teams creating digital content by 20%.
    
    Ideally, each goal should have a baseline number, like your current conversion rate for a specific category of pages. Baseline numbers relating to site visits or conversion or online revenue are relatively easy to find. For goals relating to productivity or time to market, it will likely take some work to calculate a baseline. It’s worth the effort, though, because having clear goals will help you get more value from your investment in Experience Manager.
    
1.  **For each goal, identify performance indicators.** For example, if your goal is to reduce the legal costs associated with DRM violations by $100,000, a good performance indicator might be: “100% of expired assets are removed from digital properties on or before the expiration date.” Try to come up with multiple indicators for each goal. If you started with 2-3 business objectives and 3-5 goals, you might have a list of 15-20 performance indicators.
    
1.  **Pick the 3 indicators that matter most for your business.** These are your KPIs. They might align with 3 business objectives — each championed by a different C-level executive — or all 3 KPIs might support the same objective, if everyone agrees it’s the most important one.
    
1.  **Create a measurable methodology for each KPI.** One you’ve chosen your KPIs, download our KPI Methodology template, which will guide you through the rest of the process.
    
1.  **Define the audience for each KPI.** Your last step for this week is to identify the group of stakeholders who care most about each KPI. Next week you’ll work with each group to confirm the KPI, refine the methodology, and agree on the format and timing of your reports.
