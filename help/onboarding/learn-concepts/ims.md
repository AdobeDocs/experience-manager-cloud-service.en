# Identity Management System {#intro-ims}

AEM as a Cloud Service comes pre-configured with Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) for authentication. Previously, with AEM, customers would have to configure an Identity Provider (IDP) such as Active Directory or IMS. 

AEM as a Cloud Service consolidates the login experience between AEM and the rest of the Adobe Experience Cloud. Organizations with multiple Adobe products can especially benefit by creating role-based groups in Adobe Admin Console and then assigning access to multiple products including AEM as a Cloud Service via IMS.
