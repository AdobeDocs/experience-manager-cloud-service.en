# Understand Admin Console {#intro-admin-console}

The Adobe Admin Console is a central place to administer and manage your Adobe product licenses and users. The main functionality of the Adobe Admin Console is user management. This means you do not have to create users in each solution. This centralized approach, where all user management is done in one single interface is done via Adobe Admin Console.

Sign in to the Adobe Admin console to manage user accounts, add or remove users, create groups, and more. Sign in to [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com) with  your [Adobe ID](/help/onboarding/learn-concepts/adobe-id.md). When you are invited to the Admin Console as an admin, you receive an email invitation. Click on **Get Started** to start your role as a System Administrator.
