# System Administrator {#system-administrator}

A System Administrator is part of your organization, not part of Adobe. Even though this person's primary job responsibilities may not be System Administrator, this term is used to note that this user has admin privileges in the Admin Console. 

This is the individual who is first contacted by Adobe after your contract has been signed, and is typically the first person to access and set up your AEM as a Cloud Service resources. This person manages all aspects of their users, from access to permissions by using the [Adobe Admin Console](/help/onboarding/learn-concepts/admin-console.md).
