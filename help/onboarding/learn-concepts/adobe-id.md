# Adobe ID {#adobe-id}

An Adobe ID is simply the email address, you use to login and access AEM as a Cloud Service or any of your Adobe solutions. This is the email address associated with your [identity]((https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/identity.ug.html) that your System Administrator uses to provide access to any Adobe Solutions owned by your organization.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>An Adobe ID is essential for a secure and personalized experience with Adobe applications and services, and is required when you want to buy Adobe products. By using your Adobe ID, you keep all your Adobe plans and products associated with a single account. Refer to [Create or update your Adobe ID](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/manage-account/using/create-update-adobe-id.html#HowtocreateorupdateyourAdobeID) to learn more.


There are three types of Adobe ID's:

* **Personal ID**. This is the default type of account. Basically, the user needs to create an account at adobe.com. In other words, this account is managed by Adobe and anybody can create an account of this type.

* **Enterprise ID**: Organizations usually want to increase the control of the users’ accounts. With Enterprise ID, only system administrators can create these type of accounts and the organization owns these accounts; Adobe only hosts them.

* **Federated ID**. This is  where the organization takes full ownership and control of the accounts. In this case, you need to integrate the Adobe Experience Cloud with your SAML2 SSO system. The final result is that users authenticate against their company’s SSO system and not against an account hosted at Adobe. See [SAML 2.0 Authentication Handler](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/security/saml-2-0-authenticationhandler.html#security) to learn more.

   >[!NOTE]
   >If your Enterprise ID or Federated ID has not yet been setup, your system administrator may decide to onboard your team using Personal ID's. Once the Enterprise or Federated ID is set up, members can be transitioned to using this ID.
