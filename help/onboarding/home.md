**What to expect while onboarding**

Once your contract has been signed the following events will take place:

1. Adobe will complete provisioning for your organization following which your organization's System Administrator will receive a welcome email allowing them to do [System Administrator Tasks](/help/onboarding/what-is-required/add-users-assign-cm-roles.md) including adding users, assigning them to roles, and thereby granting them appropriate access to Cloud Manager.

1. Users added by your System Administrator will in turn receive a welcome email thereby allowing them to successfully [Navigate to Cloud Manager](/help/onboarding/what-is-required/navigate-to-cloud-manager.md). Users can now use their Adobe ID to login and begin their journey with Cloud Manager from here. 

1. A System Administrator can [Grant Users Access to an AEM instance](/help/onboarding/what-is-required/accessing-aem-instance.md) for development purposes.

**Get your Adobe ID**

You will need your Adobe ID and your System Administrator's help to get users added to Cloud Manager to their assigned Roles.
