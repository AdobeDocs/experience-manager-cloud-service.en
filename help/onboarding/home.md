Congratulations on starting your journey with AEM as a Cloud Service! Whether you are deploying a new application or migrating an existing one, this guide serves as your starting point to ensure your application is optimized and ready for success on Cloud Service.

## Onboarding Experience {#audience}

Onboarding is the process during which a designated [System Administrator](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/onboarding-concepts/system-administrator.html?lang=en) sets up AEM as a Cloud Service for your organization. This includes the initial provisioning of cloud resources and assignment of users to appropriate roles based on their job responsibilities following which each member is able to login and access their AEM as a Cloud Service resources.

The onboarding journey illustrated below is designed for a System Administrator persona, laying out the requirements, steps, and approach. The journey defines additional personas with which the System Administrator must interact for a successful project, but the point-of-view for the journey is that of an administrator.
