# Onboarding System Administartor's Journey

Start here for a guided journey that helps you with the Onboarding Process in AEM as a Cloud Service.

This is the individual who is first contacted by Adobe after your contract has been signed, and is typically the first person to access and set up your AEM as a Cloud Service resources. This person manages all aspects of their users, from access to permissions by using the Adobe Admin Console.
