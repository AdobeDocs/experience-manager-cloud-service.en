# Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service and the Web Accessibility Guidelines{#aem-and-the-web-accessibility-guidelines}
 
There are many social, economical, and legal motivations for ensuring that web content is designed to be as accessible as possible to the target audience, regardless of any disability or limitations they may have. Web accessibility is therefore an increasingly important aspect of good web design.
 
Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service works with the guidelines provided by the [World Wide Web Consortium. WCAG 2.1 is the current version of the guidelines](#world-wide-web-consortium-and-wcag), which provide a list of success criteria for Level A and Level AA conformance levels.
 
Creating accessible websites and content with AEM as a Cloud Service impacts:
 
* Administrators responsible for configuring Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) to ensure accessibility features are correctly enabled.
 
* Authors using these features to create accessible websites.
 
  * Creating accessible content is a process. AEM provides the capabilities, but content authors need to ensure that they follow the techniques required to create accessible content.
 
* Template developers should also be aware of such issues when implementing the website design.
 
## WCAG 2.1 and AEM as a Cloud Service {#wcag-aem-cloud-service}
 
The following pages and sections of the AEM as a Cloud Service documentation, provide information and guidelines:
 
<!--

  Guidelines on how administrators can configure AEM for producing accessible content.
-->
 
* [Creating Accessible Content (WCAG 2.1 Conformance)](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/accessible-content.md)
 
  The WCAG 2.1 Guidelines provide a list of success criteria for Level A and Level AA conformance levels. This page details the success criteria covered by AEM, together with how to meet them when generating content.
 
* [A Quick Guide to WCAG 2.1](/help/onboarding/accessibility/quick-guide-wcag.md)
 
  Background information about WCAG 2.1.
 
<!--
* [Creating Accessible Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/using/creating-accessible-adaptive-forms.md)
 
  Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) includes a number of features and capabilities that enhance the usability of adaptive forms for users with different abilities. The solution also assists form authors in creating accessible adaptive forms.

## World Wide Web Consortium and WCAG 2.1 {#world-wide-web-consortium-and-wcag}
 
The [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) is an international community dedicated to developing web standards. To help web designers and developers produce accessible web sites the [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) published the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) in June 2018.
 
>[!NOTE]
> 
> WCAG 2.1 updates the previous version, WCAG 2.0, from 2008. See [WCAG 2.1 - Comparison with WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#comparison-with-wcag-2-0).
 
<!--
> The original version, [WCAG 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/), was published in 1999.
-->
 
>[!NOTE]
> 
>An [updated version of the guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) is currently in development, but will not be considered at this point in time.
 
Using Adobe Experience Manager, content authors and/or website owners can create web content that meets WCAG 2.1 Level A and Level AA success criteria.
 
Specific aspects of WCAG 2.1 are highlighted in our [quick guide to WCAG 2.1](/help/onboarding/accessibility/quick-guide-wcag.md).
 
### WCAG 2.1 Accessibility Conformance Levels {#wcag-accessibility-conformance-levels}
 
WCAG 2.1 provides [guidelines (with related success criteria) covering the accessibility levels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#conformance).
 
These, as they relate to AEM, are covered under [Level A and AA Conformance](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/accessible-content.md). When creating your site, you should determine the overall level to which you would like your site to conform.
 
>[!NOTE]
> 
>As it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for certain types of content, it is not recommended as a required level of conformance.
