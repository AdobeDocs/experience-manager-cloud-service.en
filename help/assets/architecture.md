# Architecture of Assets as a Cloud Service solution {#assets-architecture}

AEM Assets as a Cloud Service is based on Adobe Experience Manager and compares well with the latest offering Experience Manager 6.5. The Cloud Service offering has an adjusted architecture and functionality offering to be a cloud-native service. Changes in the underlying architecture does not allow all Experience Manager 6.5 functionality to be a part of the Cloud Service.
