# Architecture of Assets as a [!DNL Cloud Service] solution {#assets-architecture}

[!DNL Experience Manager Assets] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] is based on [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] and compares well with the latest offering [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5. The [!DNL Cloud Service] offering has an adjusted architecture and functionality offering to be a cloud-native service. Changes in the underlying architecture does not allow all Experience Manager 6.5 functionality to be a part of the [!DNL Cloud Service].
