### November 2022 release {#november-2022-release}

[!DNL Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector] version 1.9.5, released on November 11, includes the following updates:

* Experience Manager displays the `SERVER_ERROR` on the **[!UICONTROL Link External Files and Folders]** screen while accessing the asset folders due to invalid permissions on `/content/dam/collections`.

* Enabling the **[!UICONTROL Publish Assets to Brand Portal]** option on the Workfront enhanced connector configuration page creates an incorrect event. The event does not get deleted even after disabling the option.

  To resolve the issue:
  
  1. Upgrade to version 1.9.5 of the enhanced connector.

  1. Disable the **[!UICONTROL Publish Assets to Brand Portal]** option under advanced settings.

  1. Enable the **[!UICONTROL Publish Assets to Brand Portal]** option.

  1. Delete the wrong event subscriptions.
  
     1. Perform GET calls to `/attask/eventsubscription/api/v1/subscriptions?page=<page-number>`

        Execute one API call for each page number.

     1. Search for the following text to find event subscriptions that match the following URL and do not have an `objId`:

        ```
             "objId": "",
            "url": "<your-aem-domain>/bin/workfront-tools/events/linkedfolderprojectupdate<your-aem-domain>/
        ```

        Ensure that the content between `"objId": "",` and `"url"` matches the JSON response. The recommended method to do this is to copy from any Event Subscription that has an `objId` and then delete the number.

     1. Note the event subscription ID.

     1. Delete the wrong event subscription. Make a Delete API call to `<your-aem-domain>/attask/eventsubscription/api/v1/subscriptions/<event-subscription-ID-from-previous-step>`

        `200` as the response code signifies successful deletion of wrong event subscriptions.
    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If you have already deleted the wrong event subscriptions before executing the steps mentioned in this procedure, you can skip the last step of this procedure.
