# Compare Cloud Service with Experience Manager 6.5 {#compare-cloud-service-with-aem}

Need an overview from PM with change in philosophy. Link back to Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service introduction. Link back to the marketing content on how and why the SaaS offering is better.

Need an overview from PM with 2-3 major differences in how digital assets are managed in Cloud Service.

Explicitly mention what's deprecated, what is not available (yet), API changes, and what will not change.

Differences in deployment/upgrade

Differences in the up and running/get started effort

Differences in tech specs and system requirements. Mention that we do away with a lot of sizing, performance, security, etc. best practices and tasks.

Link back to whatâ€™s new and RNs.
