[!DNL Adobe Workfront] is a work management application that helps you manage the entire lifecycle of work in one place. The integration between [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] lets organizations improve content velocity and time-to-market by intrinsically connecting work and digital asset management. Within the context of managing their work in Workfront, users have access to the required documents and images.

Adobe offers to [integrate [!DNL Workfront] and [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] natively (supporting Assets Essentials and Assets as a Cloud Service)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/documents/wf-aem-integrations/wf-aem-essentials/aem-asset-integrations.html).

With the native Experience Manager integration, you can:

* Quickly set up the integration inside of Workfront.

* Automatically create folders linked between Workfront and Experience Manager.

* Easily sync metadata for existing linked assets.

* Automatically update project metadata when it's changed in Workfront.

* Smoothly connect several Experience Manager Assets repositories to one Workfront environment, or several Workfront environments to one Experience Manager Assets repository across Organization IDs.


## Adobe Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector {#enhanced-connector-information}


As of June 2022, Adobe released a new native integration for connecting Workfront with Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service. This integration has become the required method for connecting these two solutions. Any future new implementation of the enhanced connector (1.9.8 and later) to connect Workfront with AEM Assets as a Cloud Service is blocked. For more information on how to setup this integration, see [Configure the Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service integration](workfront-connector-configure.md).
