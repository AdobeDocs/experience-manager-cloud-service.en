# GraphQL API for Use with Content Fragments {#graphql-api-for-use-with-content-fragments}

## The GraphQL API {#graphql-api}

*"GraphQL is a data query language and specification developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly open sourced in 2015. It provides an alternative to REST-based architectures with the purpose of increasing developer productivity and minimizing amounts of data transferred. GraphQL is used in production by hundreds of organizations of all sizes..."* See [GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/).

## Use Cases for Author and Publish Environments {#use-cases-author-publish-environments}

The use cases can depend on the type of AEM as a Cloud Service environment:

* Publish environment; used to: 
  * Query data for JS application (standard use-case)

* Author environment; used to: 
  * Query data for "content management purposes":
    * GraphQL in AEM as a Cloud Service is currently a read-only API.
    * The REST API can be used for CR(u)D operations.
