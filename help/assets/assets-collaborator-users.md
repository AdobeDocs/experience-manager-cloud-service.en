Experience Manager Assets includes a Collaborator user type and administrators can easily add users or user groups to this user type using Admin Console. For more information, see [Onboard Collaborator Users](/help/assets/enable-assets-ultimate.md#onboard-collaborator-users).

As a Collaborator user, you can:

* Work with assets from Experience manager via integrations of Assets available to your organization in other Adobe products and non-Adobe applications.

* Create and edit assets using built-in Adobe Express and Firefly leveraging professionally designed templates, brand kits, Adobe Stock assets, and so on.


In addition, if your administrator has configured Content Hub for your organization, you can access and leverage approved assets from your organization using AEM Assets Content Hub portal. For more information on Content Hub capabilities, see [Content Hub Overview](/help/assets/product-overview.md).
