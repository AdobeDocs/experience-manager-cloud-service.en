# Smart tag your video assets {#video-smart-tags}

Purpose: for content velocity
[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a Cloud Service supports automated tagging of video assets assisted by artificial intelligence. Tagging the videos manually can be time-consuming. However, Adobe Sensei powered video smart tagging feature uses artificial intelligence models to analyze video content and add tags to the video assets. Thereby reducing time for DAM users to deliver rich experiences to their customers.

The video assets with file formats MP4, MKV, MOV, AVI, FLV, WMV, MPEG, and WebM are supported for smart tagging. The automated tagging of video assets occurs as standard asset processing after a video is uploaded, or when a re-processing is triggered. The video tagging process runs in parallel to thumbnail creation, and metadata extraction in the Asset Compute Service, thereby increasing the processing time for video assets. You can [opt-out of video smart tagging](#opt-out-video-smart-tagging) on a folder level with inheritance.
