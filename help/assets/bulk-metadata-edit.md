Using **Bulk Metadata Edit** within the Assets View, you can modify metadata for multiple assets simultaneously. Instead of editing the metadata for each asset individually, you apply changes to a large group of assets in one action. This feature enhances the efficiency, consistency, and accuracy of metadata across a large set of assets, improving asset searchability and organization. Consequently, it becomes more convenient to manage extensive collections of digital assets.

## Access Bulk Metadata Edit option {#how-to-do-bulk-metadata-edit-on-assets-view}

Follow these steps to edit the metadata of up to 100 assets at once.

1. On the Assets View, Click **Assets**, navigate to a folder and select multiple assets.
2. Click **Bulk Metadata Edit** from the top rail.
3. On this Edit metadata page, edit the following fields in **Properties** panel. 
    * **Status:** The status categorizes assets based on their review status. Select: 
        * **Approved:** For reviewed assets that are ready for use.
        * **Rejected:** For reviewed assets that are not suitable for use.
        * **No Status:** If assets are not reviewed.
    * **Expiration date:** Set a date after which the assets are no longer valid or needed. 
    * **Author:** Specify the author's name.
    * **Keywords:** Add a term or a text string that provide a high-level information about the asset to enhance asset discoverability. For example, Fruits, if the asset includes fruits. Enter a keyword and press Enter to add another keyword to the list. You can use the pipe character ( | ) to create a class of keywords. For example, â€¦.
    * **Tags:** Add a term to give specific information about the asset to enhance asset discoverability. For example, Apple rather than Fruits if the asset displays apples.
    * Click **Save** to overwrite the existing details or add the new details.
