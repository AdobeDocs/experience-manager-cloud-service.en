# Assets Insights {#asset-insights}

Assets Insights functionality lets you track user ratings and usage statistics of images that are used in third-party websites, marketing campaigns, and Adobe's creative solutions. It helps provide insights about performance and popularity of the images.

Assets Insights captures user activity details, such as the number of times an image is rated, clicked, and impressions (number of times an image is loaded on the website). It assigns scores to images based on these statistics. You can use the scores and performance statistics to select popular images for inclusion in catalogs, marketing campaigns, and so on. You can even formulate archival and license renewal policies based on these statistics.

For Assets Insights to capture usage statistics for images from a website, you must include the embed code for the image in the website code.

To let Assets Insights display usage statistics for assets, first configure the feature to fetch reporting data from [!DNL Adobe Analytics]. For details, see [Configure Assets Insights](#configure-asset-insights). To use this feature, buy [!DNL Adobe Analytics] license separately.

>Insights are supported and provided only for images.

## View statistics for an image {#viewing-statistics-for-an-image}

You can view the Assets Insights scores from the metadata page.

1. From the Assets user interface, select the image and then click **[!UICONTROL Properties]** from the toolbar.
1. From the Properties page, click **[!UICONTROL Insights]**.
1. Review the usage details for the asset in the **[!UICONTROL Insights]** tab. The **[!UICONTROL Score]** section describes the total asset usage and performance sores of an asset .

   Usage score describes the numbers of times asset is used in various solutions.

   The **[!UICONTROL Impressions]** score is the number of times the asset is loaded on the web site. The number displayed under **[!UICONTROL Clicks]** is the number of times the asset is clicked.

1. Review the **[!UICONTROL Usage Statistics]** section to know which entities the asset was part of and which creative solutions recently used it. The higher the usage, the greater the chances that the asset is popular among users. Usage data is displayed under the following heads:

    * **[!UICONTROL Asset]**: The number of times the asset was part of a collection or compound asset.
    * **[!UICONTROL Web & Mobile]**: The number of times the asset was part of websites and apps.
    * **[!UICONTROL Social]**: The number of times the asset was used in other solutions such as a [!DNL Adobe Campaign].
    * **[!UICONTROL Email]**: The number of times the asset was used in email campaigns.

   >Because the Assets Insights feature typically fetches the Solutions data from [!DNL Adobe Analytics] in a periodic manner, the Solutions section may not display the most recent data.

1. To view performance statistics for the asset graphically over a period of time, select period in the **[!UICONTROL Performance Statistics]** section. Details, including clicks and impressions are displayed as trend lines of a graph.
