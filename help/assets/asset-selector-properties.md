# Asset Selector properties {#asset-selector-properties}

You can use the Asset Selector properties to customize the way the Asset Selector is rendered. The following table lists the properties that you can use to customize and use the Asset Selector.

| Property | Type | Required | Default |Description |

The `imsOrg` key is required to authenticate whether the organization you are accessing is under Adobe IMS or not. |

| *apiKey* | String | No | | API key used for accessing the AEM Discovery service. `apiKey` is required if you are using an [!DNL Adobe] application integration.|
| *filterSchema* | Array | No | | Model that is used to configure filter properties. This is useful when you want to limit certain filter options in Asset Selector.|

| *selectedAssets* | Array `<Object>` | No       |                 | Specify selected Assets when the Asset Selector is rendered. An array of objects is required that contains an id property of the assets. For example, `[{id: 'urn:234}, {id: 'urn:555'}]` An asset must be available in the current directory. If you need to use a different directory, provide a value for the `path` property as well. |

Passing a value through this interface overrides the default translations provided and instead use your own. To perform the override, you must pass a valid [Message Descriptor](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/api/#message-descriptor) object to the key of `i18nSymbols` that you want to override. |
| *intl* | Object | No  | | Asset Selector provides default OOTB translations. You can select the translation language by providing a valid locale string through the `intl.locale` prop.
