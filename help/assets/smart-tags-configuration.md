# Configure Experience Manager for smart tagging of assets {#configure-aem-for-smart-tagging}

Tagging assets with taxonomy-controlled vocabulary ensures that the assets can be easily identified and retrieved by tag-based searches. Adobe provides Smart Tags that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to train images. Smart Tags uses an artificial intelligence framework of [Adobe Sensei](https://www.adobe.com/sensei/experience-cloud-artificial-intelligence.html) to train its image recognition algorithm on your tag structure and business taxonomy.

The Smart Tags functionality is available for purchase as an add-on to [!DNL Experience Manager]. After you purchase, an email is sent to the administrator of your organization with a link to Adobe Developer Console. The administrator accesses the link to integrate the Smart Tags with [!DNL Experience Manager] using Adobe Developer Console.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>On new Experience Manager Assets deployments, the smart tagging functionality is configured by default. You need not manually integrate with Adobe Developer Console. If it is not configured on your existing deployment, then follow the integration steps.

## Integrate with Adobe Developer Console {#aio-integration}

Before you can tag the images using SCS, integrate [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] with the Smart Tags service using Adobe Developer Console. At the back end, the [!DNL Experience Manager] server authenticates your service credentials with the Adobe Developer Console gateway before forwarding your request to the service.

* Create a configuration in [!DNL Experience Manager] to generate a public key. [Obtain public certificate](#obtain-public-certificate) for OAuth integration.
* [Create an integration in Adobe Developer Console](#create-aio-integration) and upload the generated public key.
* [Configure Smart Tags](#configure-smart-content-service) in your [!DNL Experience Manager] instance using the API key and other credentials from Adobe Developer Console.
* [Test the configuration](#validate-the-configuration).
* [Reconfigure after certificate expires](#certrenew).

### Prerequisites for Adobe Developer Console integration {#prerequisite-for-aio-integration}

Before you can use the Smart Tags, ensure the following to create an integration on Adobe Developer Console:

* An Adobe ID account that has administrator privileges for the organization.
* The Smart Tags is enabled for your organization.

### Obtain a public certificate {#obtain-public-certificate}

A public certificate allows you to authenticate your profile on Adobe Developer Console. You create a certificate from within [!DNL Experience Manager].

1. In the [!DNL Experience Manager] user interface, access **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Security]** > **[!UICONTROL Adobe IMS Configurations]**.

1. On the [!UICONTROL Adobe IMS Configurations] page, click **[!UICONTROL Create]**. From **[!UICONTROL Cloud Solution]** menu, select **[!UICONTROL Smart Tags]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Create new certificate]**. Provide a name and click **[!UICONTROL Create certificate]**. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Download Public Key]**.

### Create an integration {#create-aio-integration}

To use Smart Tags, create an integration in Adobe Developer Console to generate API Key, Technical Account Id, Organization Id, and Client Secret.

1. Access [https://console.adobe.io](https://console.adobe.io/) in a browser. Select the appropriate account and verify that the associated organization role is system administrator.
1. Create a project with any desired name. Click **[!UICONTROL Add API]**.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Add an API]** page, select **[!UICONTROL Experience Cloud]** and select **[!UICONTROL Smart Content]**. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Upload your public key]**. Provide the certificate file downloaded from [!DNL Experience Manager]. A message [!UICONTROL Public key(s) uploaded successfully] is displayed. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.
1. [!UICONTROL Create a new Service Account (JWT) credential] page displays the public key for the service account just configured. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Select product profiles]** page, select **[!UICONTROL Smart Content Services]**. Click **[!UICONTROL Save configured API]**. A page displays more information about the configuration. Keep this page open to copy and add these values in Experience Manager when further configuring Smart Tags in [!DNL Experience Manager].

   ![In the Overview tab, you can review the information provided for integration.](assets/integration_details.png)

### Configure Smart Tags {#configure-smart-content-service}

To configure the integration, use the values of Payload, Client Secret, Authorization Server, and API key fields from the Adobe Developer Console integration.

1. In the [!DNL Experience Manager] user interface, access **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Security]** > **[!UICONTROL Adobe IMS Configurations]**.
1. Access **[!UICONTROL Adobe IMS Technical Account Configuration]** page, provide a desired **[!UICONTROL Title]**.
1. In **[!UICONTROL Authorization Server]** field, provide `https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com` URL.
1. In **[!UICONTROL API Key]** field, provide **[!UICONTROL Client ID]** from the [!DNL Adobe Developer Console].
1. In **[!UICONTROL Client Secret]** field, provide the **[!UICONTROL Client Secret]** from the [!DNL Adobe Developer Console]. Click **[!UICONTROL Retrieve Client Secret]** option to see it.
1. In [!DNL Adobe Developer Console], in your project, click **[!UICONTROL Service Account (JWT)]** from the left margin. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate JWT]** tab. Click **[!UICONTROL Copy]** to copy the displayed **[!UICONTROL JWT Payload]**. Provide this value in the **[!UICONTROL Payload]** field in [!DNL Experience Manager]. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.

### Validate the configuration {#validate-the-configuration}

After you've completed the configuration, follow these steps to validate the configuration.
