# Integration with a non-Adobe application {#integrate-asset-selector-non-adobe-app}

Asset Selector allows you to integrate using various non-Adobe or third party applications to enable them to work together seamlessly.

## Prerequisites {#prereqs-non-adobe-app} 

Use the following prerequisites if you are integrating Asset Selector with a non-Adobe application:

* [Communication methods](/help/assets/overview-asset-selector.md#prereqs)
* imsClientId
* imsScope
* redirectUrl
* imsOrg
* apikey

Asset Selector supports authentication to the [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] repository using Identity Management System (IMS) properties such as `imsScope` or `imsClientID` when you are integrating it with a non-Adobe application.

## Configure Asset Selector for a non-Adobe application {#configure-non-adobe-app}

To configure Asset Selector for a non-Adobe application, you must first log a support ticket for provisioning followed by the integration steps.

### Logging a support ticket {#log-a-support-ticket}

Steps to log a support ticket via the Admin Console:

1. Add **Asset Selector with AEM Assets** in the title of the ticket.

1. In the description, provide the following details:

    * [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] URL (Program ID and Environment ID).
    * Domain names where the non-Adobe web application is hosted.

## Integration steps {#non-adobe-app-integration-steps}

Use this example `index.html` file for authentication while integrating Asset Selector with a non-Adobe application.

Access the Asset Selector package using the `Script` Tag, as shown in *line 9* to *line 11* of the example `index.html` file.

*Line 14* to *line 38* of the example describes the IMS flow properties, such as `imsClientId`, `imsScope`, and `redirectURL`. The function requires that you define at least one of the `imsClientId` and `imsScope` properties. If you do not define a value for `redirectURL`, the registered redirect URL for the client ID is used.

As you do not have an `imsToken` generated, use the `registerAssetsSelectorsAuthService` and `renderAssetSelectorWithAuthFlow` functions, as shown in line 40 to line 50 of the example `index.html` file. Use the `registerAssetsSelectorsAuthService` function before `renderAssetSelectorWithAuthFlow` to register the `imsToken` with the Asset Selector. [!DNL Adobe] recommends calling `registerAssetsSelectorsAuthService` when you instantiate the component.

Define the authentication and other Assets as a Cloud Service access-related properties in the `const props` section, as shown in *line 54* to *line 60* of the example `index.html` file.

The `PureJSSelectors` global variable, mentioned in *line 65*, is used to render the Asset Selector in the web browser.

Asset Selector is rendered on the `<div>` container element, as mentioned in *line 74* to *line 81*. The example uses a dialog to display the Asset Selector.
