A collection refers to a set of assets that can be shared among users. A collection can include assets from different locations while maintaining their referential integrity.

[!DNL Content Hub] lets you create public collections. These collections are accessible to all the entitled users, creating a shared space where multiple users can efficiently access and utilize content. Collections promote collaborative use of resources for increased efficiency and convenience. Within the collection browse page, you can: 

* **Create**: Create one or more collections.
* **View**: View the assets and their properties.  
* **Share**: Share assets as a link with others. 
* **Download**: Download the assets.
* **Remove**: Remove specific assets from a collection. 
* **Delete**: Delete the entire collection. 

It helps users to easily access and manage the diverse assets available within [!DNL Content Hub].
