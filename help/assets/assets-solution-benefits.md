# Solution benefits {#solution-benefits}

Using the new, cloud-native SaaS solution, businesses can not only perform traditional DAM operations with speed and market impact, but also use next-generation smart capabilities such as AI/ML â€“ all this from a system that is always current, always available, and always learning.

The following summarizes the benefits of Assets as a cloud service:

* **Latest software**: Always current and always updated. All users have only the latest software with all patches, features, security, and bug fixes available to them. Developers and integrators work with the latest set of APIs without issues of multi-version support.
* **Always online**: Zero downtime (0dt), thanks to the instance deployed in a cluster with backups and redundancy. Upgrades are 0dt as well.
* **Modern cloud service for asset processing**: The new Asset Compute Service is a cloud-based, scalable, reliable, and hassle-free asset processing service.
* **Highly scalable**: Elastic scalability across all types of deployments. Practically unlimited resources that are available on-demand, as and when needed. Saves the cost of over-design as compared to a traditional system.
* **Constant monitoring**: The monitoring of the system is automated and built-in checks and triggers help maintain the performance, availability, and overall robustness.
* **Hassle-free deployments**: AEM in the Cloud operations are designed to be fully automated that require no manual intervention. To achieve this, the Cloud Manager (CM) component automates the build of deployable Docker images containing your custom code.

## Business issues addressed {#business-issues-addressed}

Concurrent ingestion of large number of assets or complex assets is very resource intensive for an AEM Author instance. The primary instance consumes considerable CPU, memory, and I/O resources when assets are added, processed, or even migrated. Such performance issues impact authoring and browsing experience of end-users.

Businesses require support for a wide variety of file formats and content resolutions for multi-device, cross-geography, and multilingual use cases. Asset processing and storage requirements demand resources and capabilities that can overburden a traditional solution. At times, technical limitations of asset processing do not yield the desired results and at other times the cost of storage is an impediment for profit margins.

The new-age, exploding requirements of asset management, governance, and delivery require a new-age system that is scalable and extendable. Enter Experience Manager Assets as a cloud service to address the perennial issues of digital asset management.
