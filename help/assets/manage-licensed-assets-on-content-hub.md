# Manage Licensed Assets on Content Hub {#manage-licensed-assets-on-content-hub}

As an administrator, edit the metadata form to include the asset license field so that it displays in Asset properties in the AEM author environment. You can then approve the asset as well as its license to make the asset licensed and available on Content Hub.

Execute the following steps:

1. Edit the metadata form to include a new text field to include the license details. Map the text field to `dc:license` property. For more information on how to add fields to a metadata form and define properties, see [Setup Metadata Forms](/help/assets/metadata-assets-view.md#metadata-forms).

1. Apply the metadata form to the asset folder to apply the settings incorporated in step 1. For information on how to assign a metadata form to the asset folder, see [Assign metadata form to a folder](/help/assets/metadata-assets-view.md#metadata-forms).
1. [Approve the licensed PDF](/help/assets/manage-organize-assets-view.md#set-asset-status)
1. Select the asset and click **Details** to view its properties. In the license field added in Step 1, define the absolute path for the asset license that has been approved in Step 3 or already approved earlier. The Content Hub absolute path follows this standard pattern: `/content/dam/(The asset's folder hierarchy within the DAM repository)/(asset_name).(file_extension)`. For example, /content/dam/teamA/projects/documents/file1.pdf
