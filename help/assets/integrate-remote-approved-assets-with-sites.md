# Integrate remote AEM Assets with AEM Sites  {#integrate-approved-assets}

Effectively managing digital assets is crucial for delivering engaging and consistent brand experiences across various online platforms. Dynamic Media with OpenAPI capabilities enhances digital asset management by enabling seamless integration between AEM Sites and AEM Assets as a Cloud Service. This innovative feature allows you to easily share and manage different types of approved digital assets across multiple AEM environments, streamlining workflows for sites authors and content editors.

Dynamic Media with OpenAPI capabilities allows sites authors to use assets from remote DAM directly within the AEM Page Editor and [Content Fragment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/content/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments.html), simplifying content creation and management processes.

Users can connect multiple AEM Sites instances, without any restrictions on the maximum number, to a remote DAM deployment, a notable advantage over the [Connected Assets](use-assets-across-connected-assets-instances.md) feature.

After the initial setup, users can create pages on the AEM Sites instance and add assets as needed. When adding assets, they can either select assets stored in their local DAM or browse and use the assets available in the remote DAM.

Dynamic Media with OpenAPI capabilities offers several other benefits such as accessing and using remote assets in Content Fragment, fetching metadata of the remote assets and much more. Know more about the other [benefits of Dynamic Media with OpenAPI capabilities over Connected Assets](/help/assets/dynamic-media-open-apis-faqs.md). 

## Before you begin {#pre-requisits-sites-integration}

Support for remote assets using Dynamic Media with OpenAPI capabilities requires:

* AEM 6.5 SP 18+ or AEM as a Cloud Service

* Core Components release 2.23.2 or later

* Set up the following [environment variables](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/environment-variables.md#add-variables) for AEM as a Cloud Service:

    * ASSET_DELIVERY_REPOSITORY_ID= "delivery-pxxxxx-eyyyyyy.adobeaemcloud.com" <br>
    `pXXXX` refers to the program ID <br>
    `eYYYY` refers to the environment ID

    * ASSET_DELIVERY_IMS_CLIENT= [IMSClientId]

    or configure the [OSGi settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/content/implementing/deploying/configuring/configuring-osgi.html) for AEM 6.5 in the AEM Sites instance by following these steps:
    
    1. Sign in to the console and click **[!UICONTROL OSGi] >** or
    use the direct URL; for example: `http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr`

    1. Configure the **Next Generation Dynamic Media Config** (`NextGenDynamicMediaConfigImpl`) OSGi configuration as follows, replacing the values with those of your remote assets environment.

       ```text
         imsClient="<ims-client-name>"
         enabled=B"true"
         imsOrg="<ims-org>@AdobeOrg"
         repositoryId="<repo-id>.adobeaemcloud.com"
       ```

    Learn more about [IMS authentication](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/content/security/ims-config-and-admin-console.html).

    For details on how to configure OSGi, please see the following documents:

   * [Configuring OSGi for Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/deploying/configuring-osgi.html) for AEM as a Cloud Service
   * [Configuring OSGi](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/configuring/configuring-osgi.html) for AEM 6.5

* IMS access to sign into remote DAM AEM as a Cloud Service instance.

* Configure the Image v3 component in the AEM Sites instance. If the component is not present, download and install the [content package](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/releases/tag/core.wcm.components.reactor-2.23.0).

## Configure HTTPS {#https}

It is generally recommended to run all of your production AEM instances using HTTPs. However your local development environments may not be set up as such. However, remote assets using Dynamic Media with OpenAPI requires HTTPS in order to function.

[Use this guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/foundation/security/use-the-ssl-wizard.html) to configure HTTPS wherever you wish to use remote assets, including development environments.

## Access assets from Remote DAM {#fetch-assets}

Dynamic Media with OpenAPI capabilities allows you to access assets available in your Remote DAM instance on your local AEM Sites Page Editor and AEM Content Fragment.

### Access remote assets in AEM Page Editor {#access-assets-page-editor}

Follow the below steps to use remote assets within AEM Page Editor on your AEM Sites instance. You can do this integration in AEM as a Cloud Service and AEM 6.5.

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Sites]** > _your website_ where the AEM **[!UICONTROL Page]** is present within which you need to add the remote asset.
1. Navigate to the specific AEM **[!UICONTROL Page]** within your website under the **[!UICONTROL Sites]** section where you intend to add the remote asset.
1. Select the page and click **[!UICONTROL Edit (_e_)]**. The AEM **[!UICONTROL Page Editor]** opens.
1. Click the Layout Container and add an **[!UICONTROL Image]** component.   
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Image]** component and click ![settings icon](/help/assets/assets/do-not-localize/settings-icon.svg) icon.
1. Uncheck the **[!UICONTROL Inherit featured image from page]** option. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Pick]** and select **[!UICONTROL Remote]**.
    ![image](/help/assets/assets/uncheck-inherit-option.jpg)

    You are prompted to sign in.
1. Select the asset and click **[!UICONTROL Select]**.
1. Add an Alternative text and click **[!UICONTROL Done]**.
<br> The remote asset appears in the image component. You can also verify the delivery URL of the asset when it loads on the page or by using the 'Preview' tab. The delivery URL indicates that the asset is being accessed remotely.

You can access remote assets in AEM page editor out-of-the-box only for Image Core Component v3 and Teaser Core Component v2. For other components including custom components, customizations are required to integrate Asset Selector with those components.
