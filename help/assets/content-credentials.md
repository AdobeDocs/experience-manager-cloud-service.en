# Content Credentials {#content-credentials}

Brands are more concerned than ever about misinformation, maintaining content traceability, and preventing the tampering of assets. This highlights the need to understand the lineage of content and ensure the integrity of brand assets. The [Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_model) (C2PA) introduces the concept of Content Credentials to address these concerns. Content Credentials are detailed provenance data that provide a set of assertions about a digital asset.

This information includes: 

* **Asset Creation:** Details about when the asset was created. 
* **Authorship:** Information about the creator or author of the asset. 
* **En-route Edits:** Records of any edits or modifications made to the asset by various actors using different software along its lifecycle. 
* **Device Details:** Information about the devices used to capture or create the asset (such as images and videos). 
* **Issuer or Signer:** Information about the entity or company that certifies or signs the asset. 
* **Other Pertinent Information:** Additional data that helps establish the authenticity and integrity of the asset. 

These credentials verify the origin and edit history of the content, ensuring transparency and authenticity through proper attribution. This enhances trust among creators, editors, publishers, media platforms, and consumers by providing verifiable evidence of the asset's provenance. These assertions further support [Digital Rights Management](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/digital-rights-management-drm) (DRM) by enabling users to understand the provenance of an asset. Adoption of these standards are being driven by the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/getting-started/) (CAI) and Project Origin Alliance to protect copyright and foster trust through transparency.
 
Adobe Experience Manager Assets now supports Content Credentials, enabling users to see Content Credentials directly within the Assets view of AEM. When looking at the asset details, any image with Content Credentials (such as those created with GenAI services) shows the manifest details in a dedicated panel. If the asset is downloaded, published, or shared, the credentials remain intact with the asset.
