![Approve assets for Content Hub](assets/content-hub-approve-assets.png)

Brand Managers and Marketers maintain strict control over brand assets. Only approved and latest version of the asset is available for use within Content Hub, ensuring brand consistency across all channels and applications. 

You can approve assets using AEM Assets as a Cloud Service to streamline asset management, ensuring a controlled and efficient process for handling assets.

## Before you begin {#pre-requisites}

Before you begin, you should have:

* Access to AEM Assets as a Cloud Service

* Write permissions to edit asset metadata to be able to edit the **[!UICONTROL Status]** field available in [asset properties](/help/assets/manage-organize-assets-view.md##manage-asset-status) for an asset.

## Approve assets for Content Hub {#approve-assets-for-content-hub}

The assets marked as `approved` in Assets as a Cloud Service are automatically available in Content Hub.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Assets as a Cloud Service and Content Hub must use the same organization for the assets to display in Content Hub.

To set the asset status as `approved` using Assets view within AEM as a Cloud Service:

1. Select the asset, and click **[!UICONTROL Details]** in the toolbar.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Basic]** tab, select the asset status as `approved` from the **[!UICONTROL Status]** drop-down list.

## Manage assets uploaded using Content Hub {#manage-assets-uploaded-using-content-hub}

[Content Hub users with rights to add assets](/help/assets/deploy-content-hub.md#onboard-content-hub-users-add-assets) can [add assets to the Content Hub](/help/assets/upload-brand-approved-assets.md) either from local file system or import assets from OneDrive or Dropbox data sources. All assets display at the top-level in Content Hub irrespective of the folder structure available on your local file system or OneDrive and Dropbox data sources to enhance the search capabilities.

The display of assets uploaded using Content Hub depends on if you have [enabled the Auto-approval toggle](/help/assets/configure-content-hub-ui-options.md#configure-import-options-content-hub):

* If the **[!UICONTROL Auto-approval]** toggle is enabled, the assets that you upload using Content Hub are automatically available.

* If the **[!UICONTROL Auto-approval]** toggle is disabled, the assets that you upload using Content Hub do not display automatically. The assets are available in the `hydrated-assets` folder of your Assets as a Cloud Service environment. Navigate to the folder and [bulk edit](#bulk-approve-assets-content-hub) the status of those assets to `Approved` for those assets to display in Content Hub.
