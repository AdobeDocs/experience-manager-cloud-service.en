# Delivery  APIs {#delivery-apis}

All [approved assets](approve-assets.md) available in Experience Manager assets repository can be [searched](search-assets-api.md) and then delivered to integrated downstream applications using a Delivery URL.

Any changes made to approved assets in DAM, including version updates and metadata modifications, are automatically reflected in the delivery URLs. With a short Time-to-Live (TTL) value of 10 minutes configured for assets delivery via CDN, updates become visible across all authoring and published interfaces in under 10 minutes.

The following image illustrates the available delivery URLs:

The following table illustrates the usage of the various available Delivery APIs:

## Delivery APIs endpoints {#delivery-apis-endpoint}

The API endpoints vary for each delivery API. For example, the API endpoint for `Web-optimized binary representation of the asset in the requested output format` API is:
`https://delivery-pXXXX-eYYYY.adobeaemcloud.com/adobe/assets/{assetId}/as/{seoName}.{format}`

The delivery domain is similar in structure to the Experience Manager author environment's domain. The only difference is replacing the term `author` with `delivery`.

`pXXXX` refers to the program ID

`eYYYY` refers to the environment ID

See [API details](https://adobe-aem-assets-delivery.redoc.ly/#tag/Assets) for more information.

## Delivery APIs request method {#delivery-api-request-method}

GET

## Delivery APIs header {#deliver-assets-api-header}

You need to provide the following details while defining a header in the Delivery APIs header:

```java
headers: {
      'If-None-Match': 'string',
      Authorization: 'Bearer <YOUR_JWT_HERE>'
    }
```

To invoke the Delivery APIs, an IMS token is required in the `Authorization` details to deliver a restricted asset. The IMS token is fetched from a technical account. See [Fetch the AEM as a Cloud Service Credentials](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/developing/generating-access-tokens-for-server-side-apis.html?lang=en#fetch-the-aem-as-a-cloud-service-credentials) to create a new technical account. See [Generating the access token](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/developing/generating-access-tokens-for-server-side-apis.html?lang=en#generating-the-access-token) to generate the IMS token and use it appropriately in the Delivery APIs request header.
