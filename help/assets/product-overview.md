# Content Hub Overview {#overview-content-hub}

![Content Hub overview](assets/content-hub-overview.png)

Content Hub is available as part of Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service for democratizing access to on-brand content for organizations and their business partners. It focuses on distributing assets for activation at scale and creation of on-brand content variants for improved marketing agility.

## Why Content Hub?

Content Hub offers the following key benefits:

**Find and share all brand approved assets available in an intuitive portal** 

AEM Assets serves as a single source of truth and all approved assets are automatically available on Content Hub in a flat hierarchy to improve the search experience.

**Configurable User interface**

 The most common properties within Content Hub, such as filters for search, fields available while adding or importing assets, asset properties, banner content for branding are configurable and an administrator can easily configure the Content Hub user interface based on their requirements.   

**Empower non-creatives to edit and remix content while staying on brand**

Content Hub allows you to create new content with Adobe Express (if you have Adobe Express entitlements). You can edit existing content with easy to use tools, produce on-brand variations with templates and brand elements, and create new content with the latest GenAI capabilities from Adobe Firefly.

**Gain insights on how content is used across teams**

[!DNL Content Hub] provides valuable insights into assets, addressing a common challenge that marketing stakeholders often encounter - asset usage statistics used in marketing campaigns, channels, and different regions. By gaining a clear understanding of the performance and popularity of the assets, it delivers actionable insights essential for enhancing user experience.
