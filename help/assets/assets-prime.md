Assets as a Cloud Service Prime includes a lightweight DAM that enables you to perform various key capabilities, such as:

* **Asset management and library services**â€‹: Tools that enable users to ingest, store, catalog, control, manage, and govern a brand's digital assets in a centralized repository 

* **Search, Discovery, and Collaboration**: Tools that enable users to browse, discover, share, and collaborate on assets they need to create rich customer experiences.

* **Security & Rights Management**: Tools to manage access, permissions, rights, and security to ensure compliance, consistency, and brand integrity.

* **Creative Cloud Connections**: Tools that enable marketing & creative teams to collaborate with simplified access, comment, review, and annotations to update or finalize digital assets.

* **Experience Cloud Connections**: Tools to support native access to digital assets from other Experience Cloud applications and services.

* **Distribution Portal Experience with no extensibility options (Content Hub)**: Tools to expand access to a brand's approved digital assets to extended stakeholders to ensure usage and brand consistency.

* **Integrations**: integrations with other Adobe and non-Adobe applications.

* **Dynamic Media (add-on)**: Tools to transform and deliver images, videos, and other emerging content for rich, interactive, multimedia experiences for any device at scale.

However, as your DAM needs grow and you need more capabilities, such as, UI extensibility, API-driven automation, and custom code deployment, you must consider upgrading to [Assets Ultimate](/help/assets/assets-ultimate-overview.md).

This article provides an end-to-end workflow to enable Assets as a Cloud Service Prime.
