# Asynchronous Jobs {#asynchronous-jobs}

To reduce adverse impact on performance, Adobe Experience Manger (AEM) Assets processes certain long-running and resource-intensive asset operations asynchronously.

For further details, please see the document [Asynchrnous Jobs](/help/operations/asynchronous-jobs.md) in the Operations user guide.
