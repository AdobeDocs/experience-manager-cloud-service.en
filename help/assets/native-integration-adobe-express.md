# Native integration with Adobe Express {#native-integration-adobe-express}

AEM Assets integrates natively with Adobe Express, which allows you to directly access the assets stored in AEM Assets from within the Adobe Express user interface. You can place content managed in AEM Assets in the Express canvas and then save new or edited content in an AEM Assets repository. The integration provides the following key benefits:

* Increased content reuse by editing and saving new assets in AEM

* Reduced overall time and effort  to create new assets or create new versions of existing assets

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}
