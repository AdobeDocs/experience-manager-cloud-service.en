# Install [!DNL Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector] {#assets-integration-overview}

A user with administrator access in [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] installs the enhanced connector. Before you install, review the platform support and other [prerequisites for the connector](https://one.workfront.com/s/csh?context=2467&pubname=the-new-workfront-experience).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>* Adobe requires deployment and configuration of the [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector] only via certified partners or [!DNL Adobe Professional Services]. If deployed and configured without a certified partner or [!DNL Adobe Professional Services], it is not supported by Adobe.
>
>* Adobe may release updates to [!DNL Adobe Workfront] and [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] that make this connector redundant; if this occurs, customers may be required to transition from the use of this connector.
>
>* Adobe supports enhanced connector versions 1.7.4 and higher. Previous prerelease and custom versions are not supported. To check the enhanced connector version, see step 5(a) of [enhanced connector installation instructions](workfront-connector-install.md). 
>
>* See [Partner certification exam for Workfront for Experience Manager Assets enhanced connector](https://solutionpartners.adobe.com/solution-partners/home/applications/experience_cloud/workfront/journey/dev_core.html). For information about the exam, see [Exam Guide](https://express.adobe.com/page/Tc7Mq6zLbPFy8/).

Before you install the connector, follow these pre-installation steps:

1. [Configure the firewall](https://one.workfront.com/s/document-item?bundleId=the-new-workfront-experience&topicId=Content%2FAdministration_and_Setup%2FGet_started-WF_administration%2Fconfigure-your-firewall.html). To know the IP cluster in [!DNL Workfront], navigate to [!UICONTROL Setup] > [!UICONTROL System] > [!UICONTROL Customer Info].

1. On the dispatcher, allow HTTP headers named `authorization`, `username`, and `apikey`. Allow `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` requests to `/bin/workfront-tools`.

1. Ensure that the following paths do not exist in [!DNL Experience Manager] repository:

   * `/apps/dam/gui/coral/components/admin/schemaforms/formbuilder`
   * `/apps/dam/gui/coral/components/admin/folderschemaforms/formbuilder`
   * `/apps/dam/gui/content/foldermetadataschemaeditor`
   * `/apps/dam/cfm/models/editor/components/datatypeproperties`
   * `/apps/settings/dam/cfm/models/formbuilderconfig`
   * `/apps/dam/gui/content/assets/jcr:content/actions/secondary/create/items/fileupload`

1. This installation requires the knowledge to set a Maven project in [!DNL Experience Manager] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]. Use the following resources to understand how to include a third-party package in your Maven project:

   * [Include third-party package in your Maven project](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/deploying/overview.html#including-third-party).
   * [Deploy with [!DNL Cloud Manager]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/using-cloud-manager/deploy-code.html).

To install the add-on in [!DNL Experience Manager] as a [!DNL Cloud Service], follow these steps:

1. Download the enhanced connector from [Adobe Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aemcloud.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aemcloud/public/workfront-tools.ui.apps.zip).

1. [Access](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/managing-code/accessing-repos.html?lang=en) and clone your AEM as a Cloud Service repository from Cloud Manager.

1. Open the cloned AEM as a Cloud Service repository using an IDE of your choice.

1. Place the enhanced connector zip file downloaded in Step 1 at the following path:

   ```TXT
      /ui.apps/src/main/resources/<zip file>
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the `resources` folder does not exist, create the folder.


1. Add `pom.xml` dependencies:

   1. Add a dependency in parent `pom.xml`.

      ```XML
      <dependency>
         <groupId>digital.hoodoo</groupId>
         <artifactId>workfront-tools.ui.apps</artifactId>
         <type>zip</type>
         <version>enhanced connector version number</version>
         <scope>system</scope>
         <systemPath>${project.basedir}/ui.apps/src/main/resources/workfront-tools.ui.apps.zip</systemPath>
      </dependency>
      ```

       >[!NOTE]
       >
       >Ensure to update the enhanced connector version number before copying the dependency to the parent `pom.xml`.

   1. Add a dependency in `all module pom.xml`.

      ```XML
         <dependency>
            <groupId>digital.hoodoo</groupId>
            <artifactId>workfront-tools.ui.apps</artifactId>
            <type>zip</type>
            <scope>system</scope>
            <systemPath>${project.basedir}/../ui.apps/src/main/resources/workfront-tools.ui.apps.zip</systemPath>
         </dependency>
      ```


1. Add `pom.xml` embeds. Add the [!DNL Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector] packages to `embeddeds` section of the `pom.xml` of all your subproject. Needs it embedded in the all module `pom.xml`.

      ```XML
      <!-- Workfront Tools -->
      <embedded>
         <groupId>digital.hoodoo</groupId>
         <artifactId>workfront-tools.ui.apps</artifactId>
         <type>zip</type>
         <target>/apps/<path-to-project-install-folder>/install</target>
      </embedded>
      ```

   The target of the embedded section is set to `/apps/<path-to-project-install-folder>/install`. This JCR path `/apps/<path-to-project-install-folder>` must be included in the filter rules in the `all/src/main/content/META-INF/vault/filter.xml` file. The filter rules for the repository are usually derived from the program name. Use the name of the folder as the target in the existing rules.

1. Push the changes to the repository.

1. Run the pipeline to [deploy the changes to Cloud Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/deploy-code.html).

1. To create a system user configuration, create `wf-workfront-users` in [!DNL Experience Manager] User Group and assign the permission `jcr:all` to `/content/dam`. A system user `workfront-tools` is automatically created and the required permissions are managed automatically. All users from [!DNL Workfront] who use the enhanced connector are automatically added as a part of this group.
