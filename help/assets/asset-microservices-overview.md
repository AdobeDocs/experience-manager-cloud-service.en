Benefits of the asset microservices:

* Scalable architecture that allows for resource-intensive asset processing. No more out of memory exceptions.
* Efficient indexing and text extractions that does not impact the performance.
* Scalable service that allows for heavier operations such as workflows and Sling jobs without overflowing the observation queues.
* Scalable, effective, and cloud-native asset processing that takes care of all your asset processing.
* No more manual configurations and fiddling with configurations. OOTB provisioning and easy processing profile creation.
* Integrations of third-party software.
