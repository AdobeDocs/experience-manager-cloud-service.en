# Asset microservices overview {#asset-microservices-overview}

Benefits of the asset microservices:

* Scalable architecture that allows for resource-intensive asset processing. No more out of memory exceptions.
* Efficient indexing and text extractions that does not impact the performance.
* Scalable service that allows for heavier operations such as workflows and Sling jobs without overflowing the observation queues.
* Scalable, effective, and cloud-native asset processing that takes care of all your asset processing.

No more manual configurations and fiddling with configurations. Third-party ImageMagick or FFMPEG command line issues for customers just to ensure their TIFFs do not loose the color profile.
