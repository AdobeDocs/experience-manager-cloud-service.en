# Introducing Assets as a [!DNL Cloud Service] {#assets-cloud-service-introduction}

<!-- Need review information from gklebus -->

Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a [!DNL Cloud Service] offers a cloud-native, PaaS solution for businesses to not only perform their Digital Asset Management and Dynamic Media operations with speed and impact, but also use next-generation smart capabilities, such as AI/ML, from within a system that is always current, always available, and always learning.

Concurrent ingestion of many assets or complex assets is resource-intensive task for an Experience Manager Author instance. The primary instance consumes considerable CPU, memory, and I/O resources when assets are added, processed, or even migrated. Such performance issues impact authoring and browsing experience of end users.

Businesses require support for a wide variety of file formats and content resolutions for multi-device, cross-geography, and multilingual use cases. Asset processing and storage requirements demand resources and capabilities that can overburden a traditional solution. At times, technical limitations of asset processing do not yield the desired results and at other times the cost of storage is an impediment for profit margins.
