More convenient access to these options increases your efficiency and content velocity.

You can access My Workspace by clicking **[!UICONTROL My Workspace]** from the items available in the left navigation pane.

Pin files, folders, and collections for faster access to these items when you need them later. All pinned items display in the **Quick access** section of My Workspace. You can access them using My Workspace instead of navigating to the location where they are saved within the repository.

1. Select the item and click **[!UICONTROL Pin to Quick Access]**.

1. Select if you need to pin the item just for you, for the entire organization, or for selected groups. If you select **[!UICONTROL For groups]**, choose an existing group names in the **[!UICONTROL Pin for groups]** field.
