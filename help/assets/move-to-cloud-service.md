## About the migration tool {#migration-tool}

Link back to information about the tool in the Experience Manager as a Cloud Service docs if the tool works the same for Sites and Assets. Document the Assets-specific information here.

* How much do we want to elaborate about the Pattern Detector rules? Is there a branding term for it?
* Before migrating using the tool, is any prepping required?
* See CQ-4271901


The migration tool helps you achieve the following:

* Convert the existing workflow models to processing profiles that work with the Assets Compute Service.
* Remove unsupported steps from the workflow models.
* Disable workflow launchers.
* Merge the configurations, after user confirmation/validation, in the existing source code.

The migration tool creates processing profiles in a Maven module that users can use in the following two ways:

* Merge into one of their existing projects.
* Add the module as new sub-module.

The migration tool provides a report of the changes it made and information about the changes.

Give details about reports and logs of the tool. 

* How to access the report, including required permissions.
* How to read/interpret the report.
