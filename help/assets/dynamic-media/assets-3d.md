## 3D formats supported in Dynamic Media {#supported-three-d-file-formats-in-dm}

Dynamic Media supports the following 3D file formats.

See also [3D formats supported in Experience Manager Assets](/help/assets/file-format-support.md#support-3d-formats)

|3D file extension |File format | MIME type |Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GLB | Binary GL Transmission | model/gltf-binary | Includes the materials and textures as a single asset.|
| OBJ | WaveFront 3D Object File | application/x-tgif |  |
| STL | Stereolithography | application/vnd.ms-pki.stl |  |
| USDZ | Universal Scene Description Zip archive|model/vnd.usdz+zip | *Support for ingestion only; no viewing or interaction is available.* USDZ is a proprietary 3D format that can be viewed natively by Safari or iOS.|

The 3D Media WCM component and 3D preview on an asset's Details page is not compatible with the latest version of Chrome (97.x). Instead, to work with 3D assets, use Firefox or Safari, or use an earlier version of Chrome (96.x).

## About viewing and interacting with 3D assets {#viewing-three-d-assets}

This section describes how to view and interact with 3D assets two different ways: from within the asset details page and from within the 3D Media component in Sites.

The interactive 3D viewer includes, among other things, a collection of interactive camera controls that let you orbit, zoom, and pan the 3D asset.

The time it takes to open a 3D asset in the Asset Details page view depends on several factors. These factors include such things as the following:

* Bandwidth to the server.
* Latencies to the server
* Complexity of the image.

In addition, the capabilities of the client computer-such as a workstation, notebook, or mobile touch device-are also important to consider when you manipulate the camera interactively. A reasonably powerful system with good graphics capabilities can make the interactive 3D viewing experience smoother and more favorable.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can open the Dimensional viewer preset in the Viewer Preset Editor to practice navigating a 3D asset without the need to first upload any 3D files. The Dimensional viewer preset has a built-in 3D asset for you to interact with.
>
>See [Manage viewer presets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/managing-viewer-presets.md).

## View and interact with a 3D asset from the asset details page {#viewing-three-d-assets-from-asset-details-page}

See also [Preview assets using the software interface](/help/assets/dynamic-media/previewing-assets.md).

**To view and interact with a 3D asset from the asset details page:**

1. Make sure you have uploaded 3D assets into [!DNL Experience Manager].

    See [Upload your 3D assets for use in Dynamic Media](/help/assets/add-assets.md#upload-assets).

1. From [!DNL Experience Manager], on the **[!UICONTROL Navigation]** page, select **[!UICONTROL Assets > Files]**.
1. Near the upper-right corner of the page, from the **[!UICONTROL View]** drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL Card View]**.
1. Navigate to a 3D asset that you want to view.
1. To open the asset in the Details page, select the card of the 3D asset.  
1. On the Details page for the 3D asset, do any of the following:

    | View | Description | Mouse action | Touch screen action |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Turn your camera** | Orbit your view around the 3D scene and objects. | Left click + drag. | Single-finger press + drag. |
    | **Pan your camera**  | Pan your view left, right, up, or down. | Right click + drag. | Two-finger press + drag. |

>[!NOTE]
>
>While a web page is in the [!DNL Experience Manager Sites] **[!UICONTROL Edit]** mode, the 3D Media component displays the 3D asset but no interaction with the asset is possible. To make the asset interactive, you can use the **[!UICONTROL Preview]** feature to view the web page in the page editor with full access to the functionality of the 3D Media component.

## Publish static Dynamic Media 3D assets {#publishing-three-d-assets}

Dynamic Media accepts various 3D file formats that are supported as *static content* in Dynamic Media. Static content means that you can upload and published 3D assets, but there is no support for *dynamic* imaging or image refitting that is associated with the 3D asset. The reason is because Dynamic Media Imaging Server does not recognize 3D formats. As such, after you publish a 3D asset in Dynamic Media, you have an instant URL that you can copy. The URL for the 3D asset follows the usual Dynamic Media URL structure. However, you cannot edit any parameters in the asset's URL, unlike traditional image assets in Dynamic Media.

See also [Obtain a URL for a static asset](/help/assets/dynamic-media/linking-urls-to-yourwebapplication.md#obtaining-a-url-for-a-static-asset).

In the **[!UICONTROL Card View]**, a small globe icon appears directly below an asset's name and to the left of its date and time to indicate that it is published. In the **[!UICONTROL List View]**, a **[!UICONTROL Published]** column indicates which assets are published or which are not.

If you are using [!DNL Experience Manager] as your WCM, use this publishing method to add the Dynamic Media 3D assets directly on your web page.

See also [Publish Dynamic Media assets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/publishing-dynamicmedia-assets.md).

See also [Publish pages](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/fundamentals/publishing-pages.md).

**To publish static Dynamic Media 3D assets:**

1. Open a 3D asset (GLB, OBJ, or STL file format).
1. On the Details page, on the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Quick Publish]**.

    ![3d-asset-quick-publish](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/3d-asset-quick-publisha.png)

1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Close]** to exit the dialog box and return to the asset details page.
1. From the drop-down list to the left of the 3D asset's file name, select **[!UICONTROL Renditions]**.

    ![3d-asset-renditions](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/3d-asset-renditionsa.png)

1. Tap **[!UICONTROL original]**. When a 3D asset is published (or "activated"), the **[!UICONTROL URL]** button appears near the bottom-left corner of the page if all the following 3D asset conditions are met:
    * The 3D asset is a supported format (GLB, OBJ, STL, and USDZ).
    * The 3D asset was ingested into the Dynamic Media Image Production System (IPS).
    * The 3D asset is published.

    ![3d-asset-url](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/3d-asset-urla.png)

1. To display the 3D asset's direct production URL which you can copy and use on web pages, select **[!UICONTROL URL]**.

### Alternate methods for publishing Dynamic Media 3D assets using the Dimensional viewer {#alternate-publish-methods}

Use the following two methods for publishing Dynamic Media 3D assets if you are *not* using [!DNL Experience Manager] as your WCM.

* **[!UICONTROL URL]** - Use **[!UICONTROL URL]** if you are using a third-party web content management system and you want to link Dynamic Media 3D assets to your web pages using the Dimensional viewer.

  See [Link URLs to your web application](/help/assets/dynamic-media/linking-urls-to-yourwebapplication.md#obtaining-a-url-for-an-asset).

* **[!UICONTROL Embed]** - Use **[!UICONTROL Embed]** when you want to view a Dynamic Media 3D asset embedded on a web page using the Dimensional viewer. You copy the embed code to the clipboard so you can paste it in your web pages. Editing of the code is not permitted in the **[!UICONTROL Embed]** dialog box.

  See [Embed the Dynamic Media Video, Image viewer, or Dimensional viewer on a web page](/help/assets/dynamic-media/embed-code.md#embedding-the-video-or-image-viewer-on-a-web-page).
