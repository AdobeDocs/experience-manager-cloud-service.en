# Image Sets {#image-sets}

Image Sets give users an integrated viewing experience, where users can see different views of an item by clicking a thumbnail image. Image Sets let you present alternative views of an item and the viewer offers zooming tools for examining images closely.

Image Sets are designated by a banner with the word `IMAGESET`. In addition, if the Image Set is published, then the publish date, indicated by the **[!UICONTROL World]** icon is on the banner. Also, the last modification date, indicated by the **[!UICONTROL Pencil]** icon, is displayed.

Within the image set, you can also create swatches by creating an Image Set and adding thumbnails.

This application is useful for when you want to show an item in a different color, pattern, or finish. To create an Image Set with color swatches, you need one image for each different color, pattern, or finish you want to present to users. You also need one color, pattern, or finish swatch for each color, pattern, or finish.

For example, suppose you want to present images of caps with different color bills; the bills are red, green, and blue. In this case, you need three shots of the same cap. You need one shot with a red, one with a green, and one with a blue bill. You also need a red, green, and blue color swatch. The color swatches serve as the thumbnails that users click in the Swatch Set Viewer to see the red-billed, green-billed, or blue-billed cap.

When you create an Image Set, Adobe recommends the following best practices and enforces the following limits:

| Limit type | Best practice | Limit imposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of duplicate assets per set | No duplicates | 20 |
| Maximum number of images per set | 5-10 images per set  | 1000 |

See also [Dynamic Media limitations](/help/assets/dynamic-media/limitations.md).

## Quick Start: Image Sets {#quick-start-image-sets}

To get you up and running quickly:

1. Optional. [Create a batch set preset](/help/assets/dynamic-media/batch-set-presets-dm.md) and apply it to a new folder where your spin set images are uploaded.

   A batch set preset can help you automate the creation of your image set. 

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Batch sets are created by the IPS (Image Production System) as part of asset ingestion.

1. [Upload your primary source images for multiple views](#uploading-assets-in-image-sets).

   Upload the images for your Image Sets. Remember that users can zoom on images in the Image Set Viewer. As such, choose your images carefully. Make sure that the images are least 2000 pixels in the largest size.

   See [Dynamic Media - Supported raster image formats](/help/assets/file-format-support.md#image-support-dynamic-media) for a list of formats supported by Image Sets.

1. [Create Image Sets](#creating-image-sets).

   In Image Sets, users click thumbnail images in the Image Set Viewer.

   To create an Image Set in Assets, select **[!UICONTROL Create]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Sets]**. Then, add images and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   See [Prepare Image Set assets for upload and Uploading your files](#uploading-assets-in-image-sets).

   See [Work with Selectors](/help/assets/dynamic-media/working-with-selectors.md).

1. Add [Image Set Viewer presets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/managing-viewer-presets.md), as needed.

   Administrators can create or modify Image Set Viewer Presets. To see your image set with a viewer preset, select the image set, and in the left-rail drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL Viewers]**.

   To create or edit viewer presets, see **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Assets]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer Presets]**.

1. (Optional) [View Image Sets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/image-sets.md#viewing-image-sets) that were created using batch set presets.
1. [Preview Image Sets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/previewing-assets.md).

   Select the Image Set and you can preview it. To examine your Image Set in the selected Viewer, select the thumbnail icons. You can choose different viewers from the **[!UICONTROL Viewers]** menu, available from the left rail drop-down list.

1. [Publish Image Sets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/publishing-dynamicmedia-assets.md).

   Publishing an Image Set activates the URL and Embed string. In addition, you must [publish any custom viewer preset](/help/assets/dynamic-media/managing-viewer-presets.md) that you have created. Out-of-the box viewer presets are already published.

1. [Link URLs to your Web Application](/help/assets/dynamic-media/linking-urls-to-yourwebapplication.md) or [Embed the Video or Image Viewer](/help/assets/dynamic-media/embed-code.md).

   Experience Manager Assets creates URL calls for Image Sets and activates them after you publish the image sets. You can copy these URLs when you preview assets. Alternatively, you can embed them on your website.

   Select the Image Set, then in the left rail drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL Viewers]**.

   See [Link an Image Set to a web page](/help/assets/dynamic-media/linking-urls-to-yourwebapplication.md) and [Embed the Video or Image Viewer](/help/assets/dynamic-media/embed-code.md).

To edit Image Sets, see [editing Image Sets](#editing-image-sets). In addition, you can view and edit [Image Set properties](/help/assets/manage-digital-assets.md#editing-properties).

If you have issues creating sets, see Images and Sets in [Troubleshoot Dynamic Media](/help/assets/dynamic-media/troubleshoot-dm.md#images-and-sets).

## Upload assets for Image Sets {#uploading-assets-in-image-sets}

Start by uploading the image assets for your Image Sets. Remember that users can zoom on images in the Image Set Viewer. As such, choose your images carefully. Make sure that the images are least 2000 pixels in the largest size for optimal zoom detail. Dynamic Media can render images up to 25 megapixels each. For example, you could use a 5000x5000 megapixel image or any other size combination up to 25 megapixels.

<!-- Image Sets supports many image file formats, but lossless TIFF, PNG, and EPS images are recommended. -->

See [Dynamic Media - Supported raster image formats](/help/assets/file-format-support.md#image-support-dynamic-media) for a list of formats supported by Image Sets.

You can upload images for Image Sets as you would [upload any other asset in Assets](/help/assets/manage-digital-assets.md#uploading-assets).

### Prepare Image Set assets for upload {#preparing-image-set-assets-for-upload}

Before creating Image Sets, make sure that the images are the right size and format.

To create a multiple-view Image Set, you need images that show an item from different points of view or show different aspects of the same item. The goal is to highlight the important features of an item so viewers have a complete picture of how it appears or what it does.

Because users can zoom images in Image Sets, make sure that the images are at least 2000 pixels in the largest size. Experience Manager Assets supports many image file formats, but lossless TIFF, PNG, and EPS images are recommended.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you use thumbnails to indicate product swatches, do the following:
>
>Create vignettes or different shots of the same image showing it in different colors, patterns, or finishes. You also need thumbnail files that correspond to the different colors, patterns, or finishes. For example, to present thumbnails with an Image Set showing the same jacket in black, brown, and green, you need:
>
>* A black, brown, and green shot of the same jacket.
>* A black, brown, and green color thumbnail.

## Create Image Sets {#creating-image-sets}

You can create Image Sets through the user interface or by way of the API.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also create image sets automatically through [batch set presets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/batch-set-presets-dm.md). 
>**Important:** Batch sets are created by the IPS (Image Production System) as part of asset ingestion.

When you add assets to your set, they are automatically added in alphanumeric order. You can manually reorder or sort assets after they have been added.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Image sets are not supported for assets with "," (comma) in the filename.

When you create an Image Set, Adobe recommends the following best practices and enforces the following limits:

| Limit type | Best practice | Limit imposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of duplicate assets per set | No duplicates | 20 |
| Maximum number of images per set | 5-10 images per set  | 1000 |

See also [Dynamic Media limitations](/help/assets/dynamic-media/limitations.md).

**To create Image Sets:**

1. In Adobe Experience Manager, select the Experience Manager logo to access the global navigation console.
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Navigation]** > **[!UICONTROL Assets]**. Navigate to where you want to create an image set, then go to **[!UICONTROL Create]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Set]** to open the Image Set Editor page.

   You can also create the set from inside a folder that contains your assets.

   ![6_5_imagesets-createpulldown](assets/6_5_imagesets-createpulldown.png)

1. In the Image Set Editor page, in the **[!UICONTROL Title]** field, enter a name for the image set. The name appears in the banner across the Image Set. Optionally, enter a description.

   ![6_5_imageset-creatingnewset](assets/6_5_imageset-creatingnewset.png)

1. Do either one of the following:

    * Near the upper-left corner of the Image Set Editor page, select **[!UICONTROL Add Asset]**.

    * Near the middle of the Image Set Editor page, select **[!UICONTROL Tap to open Asset Selector]**.

   Tap to select assets that you want to include in your Image Set. Selected assets have a check mark icon over them. When you finish, near the upper-right corner of the page, select **[!UICONTROL Select]**.

   With the Asset Selector, you can search for assets by typing in a keyword and selecting **[!UICONTROL Return]**. You can also apply filters to refine your search results. You can filter by path, collection, file type, and tag. Select the filter and then select the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** icon in the toolbar. Change the view by selecting the View icon and selecting **[!UICONTROL Column View]**, **[!UICONTROL Card View]**, or **[!UICONTROL List View]**.

   See [Working with Selectors](/help/assets/dynamic-media/working-with-selectors.md).

   ![6_5_imageset-addingassets](assets/6_5_imageset-addingassets.png)

1. When you add assets to your set, they are automatically added in alphanumeric order. You can manually reorder or sort assets after you add them.

   If necessary, drag an asset's Reorder icon to the right of the asset's filename to reorder images up or down the set list.

   ![6_5_imageset-reorderassets](assets/6_5_imageset-reorderassets.png)

   If you want to change a thumbnail or swatch, click the **+** **thumbnail** icon next to the image and navigate to the thumbnail or swatch you want. When done selecting all the images click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

1. (Optional) Do any of the following:

    * To delete an image, select the image and select **[!UICONTROL Delete Asset]**.

    * To apply a preset, near the upper-right corner of the page, select **[!UICONTROL Preset]**, then select a preset to apply to all the assets at once.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When creating the image set, you can change the image set thumbnail. Or, you can let Experience Manager select the thumbnail automatically based on the assets in the image set. To select a thumbnail, select **[!UICONTROL Change thumbnail]** above the Title field on the Image Set Editor page. Then, select any image (you can navigate to other folders to find images as well). If you selected a thumbnail, then decide you want Experience Manager to generate one from the image set, select **[!UICONTROL Switch to]** **[!UICONTROL Automatic thumbnail]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. Your newly created Image Set appears in the folder you created it in.

## View Image Sets {#viewing-image-sets}

You can create image sets either in the user interface or automatically using [batch set presets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/batch-set-presets-dm.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Batch sets are created by the IPS [Image Production System] as part of asset ingestion.

However, sets created using batch set presets, do *not* appear in the user interface. You can view these sets in three different ways. (These methods are available even if you created the image sets in the user interface).

* Open the properties of an asset. Properties indicate what sets the selected asset is referenced or a member of. To see the entire set, select the set name.

  ![6_5_imageset-assetproperties](assets/6_5_imageset-assetproperties.png)

* From a member image of any set. Select the **[!UICONTROL Sets]** menu to display the sets that the asset is a member of.

  ![6_5_imageset-setspulldownmenu](assets/6_5_imageset-setspulldownmenu.png)

* From search, you can select **[!UICONTROL Filter]**, then expand **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media]** and select **[!UICONTROL Sets]**.

  The search returns matching sets that were manually created in the UI or automatically created through batch set presets. For automated sets, the search query is conducted using "Starts with". This search criteria is different from Experience Manager which is based on using "Contains". Setting the filter to **[!UICONTROL Sets]** is the only way to search automated sets.

  ![chlimage_1-134](assets/chlimage_1-134.png)

>[!NOTE]
