# Set up Dynamic Media {#setting-up-dynamic-media}

[Dynamic Media](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/assets/dynamic-media.html) helps you manage assets by delivering rich visual merchandising and marketing assets on demand, automatically scaled for consumption on web, mobile, and social sites. Using a set of primary source assets, Dynamic Media generates and delivers multiple variations of rich content in real time through its global, scalable, performance-optimized network.

<!-- OBSOLETE UNTIL THE INTEGRATING SCENE7 TOPIC GETS A MAJOR UPDATE

>[!NOTE]
>
>This documentation describes Dynamic Media capabilites, which are integrated directly into [!DNL Experience Manager]. If you are using Dynamic Media Classic (previously called Scene7) integrated into [!DNL Experience Manager], see [Dynamic Media Classic integration documentation](/help/sites-cloud/administering/integrating-scene7.md).
>
>See [Dual Use Scenario](/help/sites-cloud/administering/integrating-scene7.md#dual-use-scenario) for times when you may want to use [!DNL Experience Manager] integrated with Dynamic Media Classic along with Dynamic Media.

>[!NOTE]

>**If you are upgrading:**
>
>* After you have Adobe [!DNL Experience Manager] up and running, any asset you upload has Dynamic Media automatically enabled (unless it was explicitly disabled by your system administrator). If you are on an upgraded instance of [!DNL Experience Manager] and new to Dynamic Media, you likely must reprocess your assets to make them Dynamic Media-enabled. See [Reprocess assets in a folder](/help/assets/dynamic-media/about-image-video-profiles.md#reprocessing-assets).
