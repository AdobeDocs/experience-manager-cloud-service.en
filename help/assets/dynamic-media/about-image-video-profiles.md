# About Dynamic Media Image Profiles and Video Profiles{#about-dm-image-video-profiles}

An Image Profile or Video Profile is a recipe for what options to apply to assets that you upload to a folder. For example, you can specify what video encoding to apply to Dynamic Media video assets that you upload. Or, what Image Profile to apply to Dynamic Media image assets to have them properly cropped.

In Dynamic Media, you can create two types of profiles, which are covered in detail at the following links:

* [Dynamic Media Image profiles](/help/assets/dynamic-media/image-profiles.md)
* [Dynamic Media Video profiles](/help/assets/dynamic-media/video-profiles.md)

See also [Metadata profiles](/help/assets/metadata-profiles.md).

You must have Administrator rights to create, edit, and delete Dynamic Media Image Profiles or Dynamic Media Video Profiles.

After you create your Image Profile or Video Profile, you assign it to one or more folders that you use for newly uploaded Dynamic Media assets.

See also [Best Practices for Organizing your Digital Assets for using Processing Profiles](/help/assets/organize-assets.md).


>[!NOTE]
>
>Assets that you move from one folder to another do not get reprocessed. For example, suppose you have Folder 1 that has profile A assigned to it and Folder 2 that has profile B assigned to it. If you move assets from Folder 1 to Folder 2, the moved assets retain their original processing from Folder 1.
>
>The same is true even when you move assets between two folders that have the same profile assigned to it.

## Reprocess Dynamic Media assets in a folder {#reprocessing-assets}

You can reprocess assets in a folder that already has an existing Dynamic Media Image Profile or a Dynamic Media Video Profile that you later changed.

For example, suppose you created a Dynamic Media Image Profile and assigned it to a folder. Any image assets you uploaded to the folder automatically had the Image Profile applied to the assets. However, later you decide to add a new smart crop ratio to the Image Profile. Now, instead of having select and reupload the assets to the folder all over again, you simply run the *Scene7: Reprocess Assets* workflow.

You can run the reprocess workflow on an asset for which processing failed the first time. Even if you have not edited an Image Profile or Video profile, or you have already applied an Image Profile or Video Profile, you can still run the reprocess workflow on a folder of assets anytime.

You can optionally adjust the batch size of the reprocess workflow from a default of 50 assets up to 1000 assets. When you run the _Scene7: Reprocess Assets_ workflow on a folder, assets are grouped in batches, then sent to the Dynamic Media server for processing. Following processing, the metadata of each asset in the entire batch set is updated on [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager]. If the batch size is large, you can experience a delay in processing. Or, if the batch size is too small, it can cause too many roundtrips to the Dynamic Media server.

See [Adjust the batch size of the reprocess workflow](#adjusting-load).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are performing a bulk migration of assets from Dynamic Media Classic to [!DNL Experience Manager], enable the Migration replication agent on the Dynamic Media server. When the migration is complete, make sure you disable the agent.
>
>The Migration publish agent must be disabled on the Dynamic Media server so the Reprocess workflow works as expected.

<!-- LEAVE IN PLACE, MAY BE USED IN THE FUTURE

Batch size is the number of assets that are amalgamated into a single IPS (Dynamic Mediaâ€™s Image Production System) job. When you run the Scene7: Reprocess Assets workflow, the job is triggered on IPS. The number of IPS jobs that are triggered is based on the total number of assets in the folder, divided by the batch size. For example, suppose you had a folder with 150 assets and a batch size of 50. In this case, three IPS jobs are triggered. The assets are updated when the entire batch size (50 in our example) is processed in IPS. The job then moves onto the next IPS job and so on until complete. If you increase the batch size, you may notice a longer delay with assets getting updated.

**To reprocess Dynamic Media assets in a folder:**

1. In [!DNL Experience Manager], from the Assets page, navigate to an assets folder that has an Image Profile or a Video Profile assigned to it and for which you want to apply the **Scene7: Reprocess Asset** workflow.

    Folders that have an Image Profile or Video Profile assigned to it have the profile's name appear directly below the folder name in Card View. 

1. Select a folder.

    * The workflow considers all files in the selected folder, recursively.
    * If there are one or more subfolders with assets in the main selected folder, the workflow reprocesses every asset in the folder hierarchy.
    * As a best practice, avoid running this workflow on a folder hierarchy that has more than 1000 assets.

1. Near the upper-left corner of the page, from the drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL Timeline]**.
1. Near the lower-left corner of the page, to the right of the [!UICONTROL Comment] field, select the carat icon  ( **^** ) .

    ![Reprocess assets workflow 1](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/reprocess-assets1.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Start Workflow]**.
1. From the **[!UICONTROL Start Workflow]** drop-down list, choose **[!UICONTROL Scene7: Reprocess Assets]**.
1. (Optional) In the **Enter title of workflow** text field, enter a name for the workflow. You can use the name to reference the workflow instance, if necessary.

    ![Reprocess assets 2](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/reprocess-assets2.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Start]**, then select **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**.

    To monitor the workflow or check its progress, from the [!DNL Experience Manager] main console page, select **[!UICONTROL Tools > Workflow]**. On the Workflow Instances page, select a workflow. On the menu bar, select **[!UICONTROL Open History]**. You can also terminate, suspend, or rename a selected workflow from the same Workflow Instances page.

### Adjust the batch size of the reprocess workflow (optional) {#adjusting-load}

(Optional) The default batch size in the reprocessing workflow is 50 assets per job. This optimal batch size is governed by the average asset size and the MIME types of assets on which the reprocess is run. A higher value means you have many files in a single reprocessing job. So, the processing banner stays on [!DNL Experience Manager] assets for a longer time. However, if the average file size is small&ndash;1 MB or less&ndash;Adobe recommends that you increase the value to several 100, but never more than a 1000. If the average file size is hundreds of megabytes, Adobe recommends that you lower the batch size up to 10.

**To optionally adjust the batch size of the reprocess workflow:**

1. In [!DNL Experience Manager], select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager]** to access the global navigation console, then select the **[!UICONTROL Tools]** (hammer) icon > **[!UICONTROL Workflow > Models]**.
1. On the Workflow Models page, in Card View or List View, select **[!UICONTROL Scene7: Reprocess Assets]**.
