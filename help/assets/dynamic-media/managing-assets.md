# Manage Dynamic Media assets {#managing-assets}

{{work-with-dynamic-media}}

Managing Dynamic Media assets &ndash; images, video, and interactive assets &ndash; after they are uploaded, involves many tasks including previewing, downloading, or publishing.

When previewing, you can also apply image presets (for images only) or viewer presets (for video and images). You cannot apply both to an asset. See [Apply viewer presets](viewer-presets.md) and [Apply image presets](image-presets.md).

General information on managing assets is found in [Manage Assets with the Touch UI](/help/assets/manage-digital-assets.md).

The following topics describe what you can do to manage Dynamic Media assets:

* [Best practices for optimizing the quality of your images](best-practices-for-optimizing-the-quality-of-your-images.md)
* [Preview Dynamic Media assets](previewing-assets.md)
* [Publish Dynamic Media Assets](publishing-dynamicmedia-assets.md)
* [Work with Selectors](working-with-selectors.md)
