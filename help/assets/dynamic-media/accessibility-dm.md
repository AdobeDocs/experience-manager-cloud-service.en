# Accessibility in Dynamic Media {#working-with-three-d-assets-dm}

Dynamic Media supports keyboard control and assistive technologies, such as JAWS and NVDA screen readers, across the authoring user interface.

## Keyboard accessibility support in Dynamic Media

Because Dynamic Media is a plug-in to AEM Assets, most of the keyboard control behavior is exactly the same as in AEM Assets. For example, the `Cancel` button in Dynamic Media has the same focus highlight as in AEM Assets, and reacts to the `Spacebar` key as in AEM Assets. See [Keyboard shortcuts in Assets](/help/assets/accessibility.md#keyboard-shortcuts).

Keystrokes supported by individual user interface elements in Dynamic Media are-in most cases-obvious and easy to discover. Keyboard control in Dynamic Media is about the following:

* Ability to use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` keystrokes to navigate between interactive elements on the page.
Using `Tab` advances input focus to the next user interface element in the tabbing order; using `Shift+Tab` brings input focus back to the previous user interface element. 
The focus traversal follows the natural user interface element location on the screen and moves in a left-to-right, then top-to-bottom order. In addition, if any field has an error, you can press `Tab` to move the focus to it.
* Ability to use the `Spacebar` and `Enter` key to activate standard user interface elements, such as buttons, drop-down list, and so on.
* Ability to see the keyboard focus highlight on the active element. The user interface element that has input focus may receive a visual focus indication as a border rendered around the user interface element.
* In the Hotspot editor, you can use some custom keystrokes, such as arrow keys, to interact with complex user interface elements to reposition hotspots. 
* In the Interactive Video editor, you can use the `Spacebar` to select an image and add it to a segment. In addition, you have the ability to use the `Backspace` key to delete the selected item from the **[!UICONTROL Content]** tab. Also, pressing `Tab` functions as desired to navigateÂ between interactive elements on the page.
* In the Image Crop/Smart Crop editor, you have the ability to do the following:
  * Use arrow keys to crop the frame size, or re-position the image, or both.
  * The first `Tab` stop highlights the entire image frame. You can then use arrow keys on the keyboard to re-position the frame.
  * The next four `Tab` stops are the frame's four corners. When focus is placed on a frame corner, the corner is highlight. Again, you can use arrow keys on the keyboard to move the focused corner.

<!-- Keyboarding is the same because Dynamic Media is using the same UI library (Coral 3 (AEM 6.5) or Coral Spectrum (in Skyline)) as entire AEM Assets.  -->

<!-- In the Hotspot editor, Dynamic Media lets you use arrow keys to control the position of a hot spot. See [Carousel Banners](/help/assets/dynamic-media/carousel-banners.md##adding-hotspots-or-image-maps-to-an-image-banner) or [Interactive Images](/help/assets/dynamic-media/interactive-images.md#adding-hotspots-to-an-image-banner)  --> 

 <!-- I think we should definitely mention this in the DM-specific area of documentation for keyboard support. -->

<!-- I would not get into much of details of specific keyboard support logic of these editors. One of the reasons - chances are that accessibility support will receive Phase2-like attention, with more holistic approach. -->

## Assistive technology support in Dynamic Media {#assistive-technology=support-for-dm}

Dynamic Media user interface elements work with assistive technologies such as screen readers. For example, it recognises landmarks on a page when you navigate landmarks using keyboard shortcut `D` or regions using keyboard shortcut `R`. It also narrates the heading when navigating using the heading keyboard shortcut `H`.

## Keyboard accessibility support in Dynamic Media viewers {#keyboard-accessibility-for-dm-viewers}

All out-of-the-box Dynamic Media viewers components support keyboard accessibility for your customers.

See [Keyboard accessiblity and navigation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/dynamic-media-developer-resources/library/c-keyboard-accessibility.html) in the Dynamic Media Viewers Reference Guide.

## Assistive technology support in Dynamic Media viewers {#assistive-technology=support-for-dm-viewers}

All Dynamic Media viewer components support ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes to improve integration with assistive technologies such as screen readers.
See the **Assistive technology support** Help topic in any customizing viewer topic in the Dynamic Media Viewers Reference Guide. For example, see [Assistive technology support](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/dynamic-media-developer-resources/library/viewers-aem-assets-dmc/video/r-html5-video-viewer-20-assistive.html) for the Video viewer, or [Assistive technology support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/library/viewers-for-aem-assets-only/interactive-images/c-html5-aem-interactive-image-assistive.html?lang=en#viewers-for-aem-assets-only) for the Interactive Image viewer.
