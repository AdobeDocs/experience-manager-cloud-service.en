# Work with Selectors in Dynamic Media {#working-with-selectors}

When working with an Interactive Image, Interactive Video, or Carousel Banner, you select assets and you select sites and products for hotspots and image maps to link to. When working with Image Sets, Spin Sets, and Multimedia Sets, you also select assets with the Asset Selector.

This topic covers how to use the Product, Site, and Asset selectors, including the ability to browse, filter, sort within the selectors.

You access the selectors while creating carousel sets, adding hotspots and image maps, creating interactive videos and images.

For example, in this Carousel Banner, you use the Product selector if you are linking a hotspot or image map to a Quickview page. Use the Site selector if you are linking a hotspot or image map to a Hyperlink; use the Asset selector when you create a slide.

When you select (rather than manually enter) where hotspots or image maps go to, you are using the selector. The Site selector only works if you are an [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Sites] customer. The product selector also requires [!DNL Experience Manager Commerce].
