# Apply Dynamic Media viewer presets {#applying-viewer-presets}

A Viewer Preset is a collection of settings that determine how users view rich-media assets on their computer screens and mobile devices. You can apply any viewer presets created by your administrator to an asset.

If you are an administrator and must manage, create, sort, and delete viewer presets, see [Manage Viewer Presets](managing-viewer-presets.md).

See also [Publish Viewer Presets](managing-viewer-presets.md#publishing-viewer-presets).

You do not need to publish viewer presets depending on what publish mode you are using.

Any problems with viewer presets, see [Troubleshoot Dynamic Media](troubleshoot-dm.md#viewers).
