## Work with video in Dynamic Media {#working-with-video-in-dynamic-media}

Video in Dynamic Media is an end-to-end solution that makes it easy to publish high-quality adaptive video for streaming across multiple screens, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. An Adaptive Video Set groups versions of the same video that are encoded at different bit rates and formats such as 400 kbps, 800 kbps, and 1000 kbps. The desktop computer or mobile device detects the available bandwidth.

For example, on an iOS mobile device, it detects a bandwidth such as 3G, 4G, or Wi-Fi. Then, it automatically selects the right encoded video from among the various video bit rates within the Adaptive Video Set. The video is streamed to desktops, mobile devices, or tablets.

In addition, video quality is dynamically switched automatically if network conditions change on the desktop or on the mobile device. Also, if a customer enters full-screen mode on a desktop, the Adaptive Video Set responds by using a better resolution, improving the customer's viewing experience. Using Adaptive Video Sets provides you with the best possible viewing experience for customers that play Dynamic Media video on multiple screens and devices.

The logic that a video player uses to determine which encoded video to play or to select during playback is based on the following algorithm:

1. The video player loads the initial video fragment based on the bit rate that is closest to the value that is set for "initial bitrate" in the player itself.
1. Video player switches based on changes to the bandwidth speed using the following criteria:

    1. The player picks the highest bandwidth stream below or equal to the estimated bandwidth.
    1. The player considers only 80% of the available bandwidth. However, if it is switching up, it is more conservative at only 70% to avoid overestimating and immediately switching back.

For detailed technical information about the algorithm, see [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/master/media/libstagefright/httplive/LiveSession.cpp](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/master/media/libstagefright/httplive/LiveSession.cpp)

When managing single video and Adaptive Video Sets, the following are supported:

* Uploading video from numerous supported video formats and audio formats. Encoding video to MP4 H.264 format for playback across multiple screens. You can use predefined adaptive video presets, single video encoding presets, or customize your own encoding to control the quality and size of the video.

  * When an Adaptive Video Set is generated, it includes MP4 videos.
  * **Note**: Primary/source videos are not added to an Adaptive Video Set.

* Video captioning in all HTML5 video viewers.
* Organize, browse, and search video with full metadata support for efficient management of video assets.
* Deliver Adaptive Video Sets to the web and desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Adaptive video streaming is supported on various iOS platforms. See [Dynamic Media Viewers Reference Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/library/viewers-aem-assets-dmc/video/c-html5-video-reference).

## Best practice: Using the HTML5 video viewer {#best-practice-using-the-html-video-viewer}

The Dynamic Media HTML5 video viewer presets are robust video players. You can use them to avoid many common issues that are associated with HTML5 video playback and issues associated with mobile devices. For example, a lack of adaptive bitrate streaming delivery and limited desktop browser reach.

On the design side of the player, you can design the video player's functionality using standard web development tools. For example, you can design the buttons, controls, and custom poster image background using HTML5 and CSS to help you reach your customers with a customized appearance.

On the playback side of the viewer, it automatically detects the browser's video capability. It then serves the video using HLS or DASH, also known as adaptive video streaming. Or, if those delivery methods are not present then HTML5 progressive is used instead.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To use DASH for your videos, Adobe Technical Support must first enable it on your account. See [Enable DASH on your account](#enable-dash).

You can combine into a single player the ability to design the playback components using HTML5 and CSS. It can have embedded playback, and use adaptive and progressive streaming depending on the browser's capability. All this functionality means you can extend the reach of your rich media content to both desktop and mobile users, and ensure a streamlined video experience.

### Playback of video on desktop computers and mobile devices using the HTML5 video viewer {#playback-of-video-on-desktop-computers-and-mobile-devices-using-the-html-video-viewer}

For desktop and mobile adaptive video streaming, the videos used for bit rate switching are based on all MP4 videos in the Adaptive Video Set.

Video playback occurs using either HLS or DASH, or progressive video download. In prior versions of Experience Manager, such as 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2, videos were streamed over HTTP.

However, in Experience Manager 6.3 and on, videos are now streamed over HTTPS (that is, HLS or DASH) because the DM gateway service URL always uses HTTPS as well. There is no customer impact in this default behavior. Video streaming always occurs over HTTPS if the browser supports it. See the following table.

Therefore,

* If you have an HTTPS website with HTTPS video streaming, streaming is fine.
* If you have an HTTP website with HTTPS video streaming, streaming is fine and there are no mixed content issues from the web browser.

DASH is the international standard and HLS is an Apple standard. Both are used for adaptive video streaming. And, both technologies automatically adjust playback based on network bandwidth capacity. It also lets the customer "seek" to any point in the video without the need to wait for the rest of the video to download.

Progressive video is delivered by downloading and storing the video locally on a user's desktop system or mobile device.

The following table describes the device, browser, and playback method of videos on desktop computers and mobile devices using the [Dynamic Media HTML5 Video Viewer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/library/viewers-for-aem-assets-only/interactive-video/c-html5-aem-int-video#interactive-video).

## Best practices for encoding videos {#best-practices-for-encoding-videos}

The **Dynamic Media Encode Video** workflow encodes video if you have enabled Dynamic Media and set up Video Cloud Services. This workflow captures workflow process history and failure information. If you have enabled Dynamic Media and set up Video Cloud Services, the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Encode Video]** workflow automatically takes effect when you upload a video. (If you are not using Dynamic Media, the **[!UICONTROL DAM Update Asset]** workflow takes effect.)

The following are best-practice tips for encoding source video files.

<!-- For advice about video encoding, see the following:

* [Streaming 101: The Basics — Codecs, Bandwidth, Data Rate, and Resolution](https://www.adobe.com/go/learn_s7_streaming101_en).
* [Video Encoding Basics](https://www.adobe.com/go/learn_s7_encoding_en). -->

### Source video files {#source-video-files}

When you encode a video file, use a source video file of the highest possible quality. Avoid using previously encoded video files because these files are already compressed, and further encoding creates a subpar quality video.

* Dynamic Media supports primarily short-form videos with a maximum length of 30 minutes and a minimum resolution that is greater than 25 x 25.
* You can upload primary source video files that are up to 15 GB each.

The following table describes the recommended size, aspect ratio, and minimum bit rate that your source video files must have before you encode them:

|Size|Aspect ratio|Minimum bit rate|
|--- |--- |--- |
|1024 X 768|4:3|4500 kbps for most videos.|
|1280 X 720|16:9|3000 - 6000 kbps, depending on the amount of motion in the video.|
|1920 X 1080|16:9|6000 - 8000 kbps, depending on the amount of motion in the video.|

### Obtain a file's metadata {#obtaining-a-file-s-metadata}

You can obtain a file's metadata by viewing its metadata using an editing tool for videos, or using an application designed for obtaining metadata. Following are instructions for using MediaInfo, a third-party application, to obtain a video file's metadata:

1. Go to [MediaInfo Download](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download).
1. Select and download the installer for the GUI version, and follow the installation instructions.
1. After installation, either right-click the video file (Windows&reg; only) and select MediaInfo, or open MediaInfo and drag your video file into the application. You see all metadata associated with your video file, including its width, height, and fps.

### Aspect ratio {#aspect-ratio}

When you choose or create a video encoding preset for your primary source video file, make sure that the preset has the same aspect ratio. This approach ensures consistency with the primary source video file. The aspect ratio is the ratio of the width to the height of the video.

To determine the aspect ratio of a video file, obtain the file's metadata. Note the file's width and height (see Obtaining a file's metadata above). Then use this formula to determine the aspect ratio:

width/height = aspect ratio

The following table describes how formula results translate to common aspect ratio choices:

|Formula result|Aspect ratio|
|--- |--- |
|1.33|4:3|
|0.75|3:4|
|1.78|16:9|
|0.56|9:16|

For example, a video that is 1440 width x 1080 height has an aspect ratio of 1440/1080, or 1.33. In this case, you choose a video encoding preset with a 4:3 aspect ratio to encode the video file.

### Bitrate {#bitrate}

The bitrate is the amount of data that is encoded to make up a single second of video playback. The bitrate is measured in kilobits per second (Kbps).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because all codecs use lossy compression, bitrate is the most important factor in video quality. With lossy compression, the more you compress a video file, the more the quality is degraded. For this reason, all other characteristics being equal (the resolution, frame rate, and codec), the lower the bitrate, the lower the quality of the compressed file.

When selecting a bitrate encoding, there are two types you can choose:

* **[!UICONTROL Constant Bitrate Encoding]** (CBR) - During CBR encoding, the bitrate, or the number of bits per second, is kept the same throughout the encoding process. CBR encoding persists the set data rate to your setting over the entire video. Also, CBR encoding does not optimize media files for quality but does save on storage space.
  Use CBR if your video contains a similar motion level throughout the entire video. CBR is most commonly used for streaming video content. See also [Use custom-added video encoding parameters](/help/assets/dynamic-media/video-profiles.md#using-custom-added-video-encoding-parameters).

* **[!UICONTROL Variable Bitrate Encoding]** (VBR) - VBR encoding adjusts the data rate down and to the upper limit that you set, based on the data required by the compressor. This functionality means that during a VBR encoding process the bitrate of the media file dynamically increases or decreases depending on the media file's bitrate needs.
  VBR takes longer to encode but produces the most favorable results; the quality of the media file is superior. VBR is most commonly used for http progressive delivery of video content.

When do you use VBR versus CRB?
When selecting VBR versus CBR, it is almost always recommended that you use VBR for your media files. VBR provides higher-quality files at competitive bitrates. When you use VBR, be sure you use with two-pass encoding, and set the maximum bitrate to be 1.5x the target video bitrate.

When you choose a video encoding preset, be sure you account for the target user's connection speed. Choose a preset with a data rate that is 80 percent of that speed. For example, if the target user's connection speed is 1000 Kbps, the best preset is one with a video data rate of 800 Kbps.

This table describes the data rate of typical connection speeds.

|Speed (Kbps)|Connection type|
|--- |--- |
|256|Dial-up connection.|
|800|Typical mobile connection. For this connection, target a data rate in the range of 400 to a maximum of 800 for 3G experiences.|
|2000|Typical broadband desktop connection. For this connection, target a data rate in the 800-2000 Kbps range, with most targets averaging 1200-1500 Kbps.|
|5000|Typical high-broadband connection. Encoding in this upper range is not recommended because video delivery at this speed is not available to most consumers.|

### Resolution {#resolution}

**Resolution** describes a video file's height and width in pixels. Most source video is stored at a high resolution (for example, 1920 x 1080). For streaming purposes, source video is compressed to a smaller resolution (640 x 480 or smaller).

Resolution and data rate are two integrally linked factors that determine video quality. To maintain the same video quality, the higher the number of pixels in a video file (the higher the resolution), the higher the data rate must be. For example, consider the number of pixels per frame in a 320 x 240 resolution and a 640 x 480 resolution video file:

|Resolution|Pixels per frame|
|--- |--- |
|320 x 240|76,800|
|640 x 480|307,200|

The 640 x 480 file has four times more pixels per frame. To achieve the same data rate for these two example resolutions, you apply four times the compression to the 640 x 480 file, which can reduce the quality of the video. Therefore, a video data rate of 250 Kbps produces high-quality viewing at a 320 x 240 resolution, but not at a 640 x 480 resolution.

In general, the higher data rate you use, the better your video appears, and the higher resolution you use, the higher data rate you must maintain viewing quality (compared to lower resolutions).

Because resolution and data rate are linked, you have two options when encoding video:

* Choose a data rate and then encode at the highest resolution that appears good at the data rate you chose.
* Choose a resolution and then encode at the data rate necessary to achieve high-quality video at the resolution you chose.

When you choose (or create) a video encoding preset for your primary source video file, use this table to target the correct resolution:

|Resolution|Height (pixels)|Screen size|
|--- |--- |--- |
|240p|240|Tiny screen|
|300p|300|Small screen typically for mobile devices|
|360p|360|Small screen|
|480p|480|Medium screen|
|720p|720|Large screen|
|1080p|1080|High-definition large screen|

### Fps (Frames per second) {#fps-frames-per-second}

In the United States and Japan, most video is shot at 29.97 fps; in Europe, most video is shot at 25 fps. A film is shot at 24 fps.

Choose a video encoding preset that matches the fps rate of your primary source video file. For example, if your primary source video is 25 fps, choose an encoding preset with 25 fps. By default, all custom encoding uses the primary source video file's fps. For this reason, you do not need to specify the fps setting explicitly when you create a video encoding preset.

### Video encoding dimensions {#video-encoding-dimensions}

For optimal results, select encoding dimensions such that the source video is a whole multiple of all your encoded videos.

To calculate this ratio, you divide source width by encoded width to get the width ratio. Then, you divide source height by encoded height to get the height ratio.

If the resulting ratio is a whole integer, it means that the video is optimally scaled. If the resulting ratio is not a whole integer, it impacts video quality by leaving leftover pixel artifacts on the display. This effect is most noticeable when the video has text.

As an example, suppose that your source video is 1920 x 1080. In the following table, the three encoded videos provide the optimal encoding settings to use.

|Video Type|Width x Height|Width Ratio|Height Ratio|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Source|1920 x 1080|1|1|
|Encoded|960 x 540|2|2|
|Encoded|640 x 360|3|3|
|Encoded|480 x 270|4|4|

### Encoded video file format {#encoded-video-file-format}

Dynamic Media recommends using MP4 H.264 video encoding presets. Because MP4 files use the H.264 video codec, it provides high-quality video but in a compressed file size.

## View video reports {#viewing-video-reports}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Video reports are only available when you run Dynamic Media - Hybrid mode.

Video Reports display several aggregate metrics across a specified period to help you monitor that *published* individual and aggregate videos are performing as expected. The following top metrics data are aggregated for all published videos across your entire website:

* Video Starts
* Completion Rate
* Average time on video
* Total time on video
* Videos per visit

A table of all *published* videos is also listed so you can track the top viewed videos on your website based on total video starts.

When you select a video name in the list, it shows you the video's audience retention (drop-off) report in the form of a line chart. The chart displays the number of views for any given moment of time during video playback. When you play the video, the vertical bar tracks in synchronization with the time indicator in the player. Drops in the line chart data indicate where your audience drops off from disinterest.

If the video was encoded outside of Adobe Experience Manager Dynamic Media, the audience retention (drop-off) chart and the Play Percentage data in the table are not available.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Tracking and reporting data is based exclusively on the use of Dynamic Media's own video player and associated video player preset. As such, you cannot track and report on videos that other video players play.

By default, the first time you enter Video Reports, the report displays video data starting at the first of the current month and ends with the current month's date. However, you can override the default date range by specifying your own date range. The next time in Video Reports, the date range you specified is used.

For Video Reports to work correctly, a Report Suite ID is automatically created when Dynamic Media Cloud Services is configured. At the same time, the Report Suite ID is pushed to the Publish server so that it is available for the Copy URL feature when you preview assets. However, this functionality requires the Publish server be already set up. If the Publish server is not set up, you can still publish to see the video report. However, you must return to the Dynamic Media Cloud Configuration and select **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

**To view video reports:**

1. In the upper-left corner of Experience Manager, select the Experience Manager logo. In the left rail, go to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** (hammer icon) > **[!UICONTROL Assets]** > **[!UICONTROL Video Reports]**.
1. On the Video Reports page, do one of the following:

    * Near the upper-right corner, select the **[!UICONTROL Refresh Video Report]** icon.
      You can use Refresh only if the end date of the report is the current day. This feature ensures that you can see the video tracking that has occurred since the last time you ran the report.

    * Near the upper-right corner, select the **[!UICONTROL Date Picker]** icon.
      Specify the beginning and end date range for which you want video data, and then select **[!UICONTROL Run Report]**.

   The Top Metrics group box identifies various aggregate measurements for all *published* videos across your site.

### Viewing video reports based on a video viewer that you created using the Dynamic Media HTML5 Viewer SDK {#viewing-video-reports-based-on-a-video-viewer-that-you-created-using-the-scene-hmtl-viewer-sdk}

If you are using an out-of-box video viewer provided by Dynamic Media, or if you created a custom viewer preset based off of an out-of-box video viewer, then no additional steps are required to view video reports. However, if you have created your own video viewer based off the Dynamic Media HTML5 Viewer SDK, then use the following steps to ensure the your video viewer is sending tracking events to Dynamic Media Video Reports.

Use the Dynamic Media Viewers Reference and the Dynamic Media HTML5 Viewers SDK to create your own video viewers.

See [Dynamic Media Viewers Reference Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/library/home.html).

Download the Scene7 HTML Viewer SDK from Adobe Developer Connection.

See [Adobe Developer Connection](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/scene7/using/WSef8d5860223939e2-43dedf7012b792fc1d5-8000.html).

**To view Video Reports based on a video viewer that you created using the Dynamic Media HTML5 Viewer SDK:**

1. Navigate to any published video asset.
1. Near the upper-left corner of the asset's page, from the drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL Viewers]**.
1. Select any video viewer preset and copy the embed code.
1. In the embed code, find the line with the following:

   `videoViewer.setParam("config2", "<value>");`

   The `config2` parameter enables tracking in HTML5 Viewers. It is also a company-specific preset that contains the configuration information for Video Reporting, and for customer-specific Adobe Analytics configurations.

   The correct value for the config2 parameter is found in both the **[!UICONTROL Embed Code]** and in the copy **[!UICONTROL URL]** function. In the URL from the copy **[!UICONTROL URL]** command, the parameter to look for is `&config2=<value>` . The value is almost always `companypreset`, but in some instances it can also be `companypreset-1`, `companypreset-2`, and so forth.

1. In your custom video viewer code, add AppMeasurementBridge .jsp to the viewer page by doing the following:

    * First, determine if you need the `&preset` parameter.
      If the `config2` parameter is `companypreset`, you do *not *need `&preset=parameter`.
      If `config2` is anything else, set the preset parameter the same as the `config2` parameter. For example, if `config2=companypreset-2`, add `&param2=companypreset-2` to the AppMeasurmentBridge.jsp URL.

    * Then, add the AppMeasurementBridge.jsp script:
      `<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="https://s7d1.scene7.com/s7viewers/AppMeasurementBridge.jsp?company=robindallas&preset=companypreset-2"></script>`

1. Create the TrackingManager component by doing the following:

    * After calling `s7sdk.Utils.init();` create a TrackingManager instance to track events by adding the following:
      `var trackingManager = new s7sdk.TrackingManager();`

    * Connect components to TrackingManager by doing the following:
      In the `s7sdk.Event.SDK_READY` event handler, attach the component you want to track to the TrackingManager.
      For example, if the component is `videoPlayer`, add
      `trackingManager.attach(videoPlayer);`
      to attach the component to the trackingManager. To track multiple viewers on a page, use multiple tracking mangaer components.

    * Create the AppMeasurementBridge object by adding the following:

      ```
      var appMeasurementBridge = new AppMeasurementBridge(); appMeasurementBridge.setVideoPlayer(videoPlayer);
      ```

    * Add the tracking function by adding the following:

      ```
      trackingManager.setCallback(appMeasurementBridge.track,
       appMeasurementBridge);
      ```

   The appMeasurementBridge object has a built-in track function. OBSOLETE However, you can provide your own to support multiple tracking systems or other functionality.

   For more information, see *Using the TrackingManager Component* in the *Scene7 HTML5 Viewer SDK User Guide* available for download from [Adobe Developer Connection](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/scene7/using/WSef8d5860223939e2-43dedf7012b792fc1d5-8000.html).

## Enable DASH, multi-captions and multi-audio tracks, and AI-generated captions support on your Dynamic Media account {#enable-dash}

You can enable support in Dynamic Media for:

* DASH
* Multi-captions and audio tracks
* AI-generated captions 

By way of an Adobe Customer Support case that you create and submit. 

Enabling any of the above three capabilities, enables all of them. So, if you only want DASH enabled, you are actually enabling all three capabilities listed above.  

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DASH | DASH (Digital Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) is the international standard for video streaming and is widely adopted across different video viewers. When DASH is enabled on your account, you get the option to choose from either DASH or HLS for adaptive video streaming. Or, you can opt for both with automatic switching between players when **[!UICONTROL auto]** is selected as the playback type in the Viewer preset.<br>Some key benefits from enabling DASH on your account include the following:<br>&bull;Package DASH stream video for adaptive bitrate streaming. This method leads to higher efficiency of delivery. Adaptive streaming ensures the best viewing experience for your customers.<br>&bull;Browser optimized streaming with Dynamic Media players switches between HLS and DASH streaming to ensure the best quality of service. The video player auto-switches to HLS when a Safari browser is used.<br>&bull;You can configure your preferred streaming method (HLS or DASH) by editing the video viewer preset.<br>&bull;Optimized video encoding ensures that no additional storage is used while enabling DASH capability. A single set of video encodings is created for both HLS and DASH to optimize video storage costs.<br>&bull;Helps make video delivery more accessible for your customers.<br>&bull;Get the streaming URL by way of APIs, too. |
| Multi-captions and audio tracks | You can benefit from having multiple caption and audio track support automatically enabled. After enablement, all subsequent videos that you upload are processed with a new backend architecture that includes support for adding multiple caption and audio tracks to your videos. |
| AI-generated captions | Create captions for your videos powered by AI. Using AI, it creates the transcript of the video and converts it into captions. Even the timeline is defined, too. |

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Any videos that you uploaded *before* enabling multiple caption and audio track support on your Dynamic Media account, [must be reprocessed](/help/assets/dynamic-media/about-image-video-profiles.md#reprocessing-assets). This video reprocessing step is necessary so that multiple caption and audio track capability is available to them. The video URLs continue to work and play as usual, after reprocessing.

**To enable DASH, multi-captions and multi-audio tracks, and AI-generated captions support on your Dynamic Media account:** 

1. [Use the Admin Console to start the creation of a new support case](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/support-for-experience-cloud.html).
1. To create a support case, follow the instructions while ensuring you provide the following information:

    * Create your [video profile](/help/assets/dynamic-media/video-profiles.md) as usual.
    * [Add multiple captions and audio tracks](#add-msma) to your video.


## About multiple caption and audio track support for videos in Dynamic Media{#about-msma}

With multiple caption and audio track capability in Dynamic Media, you can easily add multiple audio tracks. You can also add multiple caption files using either your own `.vtt` (Video Text Track) files or AI-generated caption files. AI-generated captions in Dynamic Media are designed to enhance video accessibility and engagement by automatically generating accurate and synchronized subtitles. This technology uses advanced AI algorithms to transcribe spoken content into text, which is then displayed as captions on the video. Some key features of this technology include the following:

* **Automatic Transcription:** The AI system transcribes spoken words into text in real-time, ensuring that captions are generated quickly and accurately.
* **Multilingual Support:** Captions can be automatically delivered in more than 60 languages, making it easier to reach a global audience.
* **Enhanced Accessibility:** By providing captions, videos become more accessible to viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing, or people who prefer to watch videos with the sound off.
* **Improved Engagement:** Captions can help retain viewer attention and improve comprehension, especially in noisy environments or when the viewer's native language is different from the video's language.

These features make AI-powered captions a valuable tool for content creators looking to enhance their video content's accessibility and engagement. 

![Captions and audio tracks tab in Dynamic Media along with a table showing uploaded .VTT caption files and uploaded .MP3 audio track files for a video.](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/msma-caption-audiotracks-tab2.png)

Some of the use cases to consider for adding multiple captions and audio tracks to your primary video include the following:

| Type | Use case |
|--- |--- |
| **Captions** | Multiple language support |
|  | Descriptive text for accessibility |
| **Audio tracks** | Multiple language support  |
|  | Commentary tracks |
|  | Descriptive audio |

All [video formats supported in Dynamic Media](/help/assets/file-format-support.md) and all Dynamic Media video viewers - except the Dynamic Media *Video_360* viewer - are supported for use with multiple captions and audio tracks.

Multi-caption and multi-audio track capability is available for your Dynamic Media account by way of a feature toggle that must be enabled (turned on) by Adobe Customer Support.

### Add multiple captions and audio tracks to your video {#add-msma}

Before you add multiple caption and audio tracks to your video, be sure you already have the following in-place:

* Dynamic Media is set up in an AEM environment.
* A [Dynamic Media Video profile is applied to the folder where your videos are ingested](/help/assets/dynamic-media/video-profiles.md#applying-a-video-profile-to-folders).
* [Multi-caption/audio tracks and AI-generated captions are enabled on your Dynamic Media account](#enable-dash).

Added captions are supported with WebVTT and Adobe VTT formats. And, added audio track files are supported with MP3 format.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>For videos uploaded *before* enabling multiple caption/audio track support or AI-generated captions on your Dynamic Media account, [you need to reprocess them](/help/assets/dynamic-media/about-image-video-profiles.md#reprocessing-assets). This reprocessing step ensures that these videos can use the multiple caption/audio track and AI-generated caption features. After reprocessing, the video URLs continue to function and play as usual.

**To add multiple captions and audio tracks to your video:**

1. [Upload your primary video to a folder](/help/assets/manage-video-assets.md#upload-and-preview-video-assets) that already has a video profile assigned to it.
1. Navigate to the uploaded video asset that you want to add multiple caption and audio tracks.
1. In asset selection mode, either from the List View or the Card View, select the video asset.
1. On the toolbar, click the Properties icon (a circle with an "i" in it).
![Selected video asset with checkmark over video thumbnail image and View Properties highlighted on the toolbar.](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/msma-selectedasset-propertiesbutton.png)*Selected video asset in Card View.*
1. On the video's Properties page, select the **[!UICONTROL Captions & Audio Tracks]** tab.

   >[!TIP]
   >If you do not see the **[!UICONTROL Captions & Audio Tracks]** tab, it means either one of two things:
   >
   >* The folder in which the selected video resides does not have a video profile assigned to it. In which case, see [Apply a video profile to the folder](/help/assets/dynamic-media/video-profiles.md#applying-video-profiles-to-specific-folders)
   >* Or, Dynamic Media must reprocess the video. In which case, see [Reprocess Dynamic Media assets in a folder](/help/assets/dynamic-media/about-image-video-profiles.md#reprocessing-assets).
   >
   >When you have completed either one of the above tasks, return to these steps.

#### About adding caption and audio track files to a video that is already published

After uploading additional caption or audio track files to a published video, these files have a `Processed` status after they are prepared. You can then preview the video in Dynamic Media to see or hear the new files. 

Following preview, however, you must *publish* the video again for the newly added caption or audio track files to be published, too. After publishing, the captions or audio becomes available with the public Dynamic Media URL.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Based on the caching settings of your instance, metadata updates can take several minutes before they are reflected in preview and in published URLs.

In the scenario where you have configured Dynamic Media for immediate publish, the uploading of additional caption or audio files immediately triggers a publish of the video following the upload of caption or audio files.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>When you upload caption files or audio files to a video that is either published or unpublished, the files are deleted if you [*reprocess*](/help/assets/dynamic-media/about-image-video-profiles.md#reprocessing-assets) the video. Only the video's original audio remains intact. In such cases, you must reupload the caption files and audio track files to the video, again.

#### Add multiple captions to a video that has an existing URL with caption modifier

Dynamic Media supports the addition of a single caption with video by way of a URL modifier. See [Add captions to video](#adding-captions-to-video).

Multiple caption changes take precedence over a caption added by way of a URL modifier for published videos.

**To add multiple captions to a video that has an existing URL with caption modifier:**

1. Upload the caption file that is already added as a modifier to the video, so you can manage the file explicitly.
1. Upload any additional caption files, as necessary.
1. Publish the video as usual.
The existing URL with the caption modifier can now load multiple captions.

### View the lifecycle status of uploaded caption and audio track files{#lifecycle-status-video}

You can observe the lifecycle status of any caption or audio track file uploaded to your primary video. You can do so from the **Captions & Audio Tracks** tab of **Properties**.

**To view the lifecycle status of a video:**

1. Navigate to the video asset whose lifecycle status you want to view.
1. In asset selection mode, either from the List View or the Card View, select the video asset.
1. On the toolbar, select the Properties icon (a circle with an "i" in it).
1. On the Properties page, select the **[!UICONTROL Captions & Audio Tracks]** tab. In the Status column, note the state of each caption or audio file.

| Caption or Audio Track Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Processing | When a new caption or audio track file is added and saved, it goes into a "Processing" state. Dynamic Media processes the file by attaching the streaming manifest to the primary video. |
| Processed | After processing is complete, the caption or audio track file, or the original audio track associated with the primary video, appear in a "Processed" state. You can preview caption and audio track files that appear as "Processed" *before* you publish the video live. |
| Published | A "Published" state represents a similar state as "Published" for a primary video. Assets are published when the primary video is published and are available on the public Dynamic Media URL. |
| Failed | A "Failed" state means that processing of a caption or audio track file did not complete. Delete the caption or audio track file and upload again. |
| Unpublished | When a published primary video is unpublished explicitly, any caption or audio track files that you added to the video, are also unpublished. |   

![Status column highlighted for Captions and Audio Tracks fields.](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/msma-lifecycle-status.png)*Lifecycle status of each uploaded caption and audio track file.*

### Set the default audio for a video that has multiple audio tracks

By default, a video's original audio is set as the default audio to be played. 

However, any uploaded audio track files can be set as the default audio to play after a video is loaded into the viewer. In the Properties user interface, under the **Captions & Audio Tracks** tab, the `Default` label is applied to the right of the audio track file for video playback. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The playback of default audio can also depend on what is set in the following browsers:
>
>* Chrome - The default audio that is set in the video, is played.
>* Safari - If the default language is set in Safari, audio is played with the set default language, if available with the video's manifest. Otherwise, the default audio that is set as part of a video's properties is played.

**To set the default audio for a video that has multiple audio tracks:**

1. Navigate to the video asset whose default audio track you want to set.
1. In asset selection mode, either from the List View or the Card View, select the video asset.
1. On the toolbar, select the Properties icon (a circle with an "i" in it).
1. On the Properties page, select the **[!UICONTROL Captions & Audio Tracks]** tab. 
1. Under the **Audio Tracks** heading, select the audio track file that you want to set as the video's default.

### Preview a video that has multiple captions and audio tracks{#preview-video-audio-subtitle}

After caption files and audio track files are uploaded to a video and processed, you can use the Dynamic Media video viewer to preview all the different tracks. Doing so helps you to see what your video looks and sounds like to customers and ensures that it is behaving as expected.

When you are satisfied with the video, you can [publish it](publishing-dynamicmedia-assets.md) using any one of the following methods.

See [Embed the Video or Image Viewer on a Web Page](/help/assets/dynamic-media/embed-code.md).
See [Link URLs to your web application](/help/assets/dynamic-media/linking-urls-to-yourwebapplication.md). The URL-based method of linking is not possible if your interactive content has links with relative URLs, particularly links to Experience Manager Sites pages.
See [Add Dynamic Media Assets to pages](/help/assets/dynamic-media/adding-dynamic-media-assets-to-pages.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The default Experience Manager Preview tab does not show multiple caption and audio tracks. The reason is because those tracks are associated with Dynamic Media and can only be seen using Dynamic Media Viewer preview.

**To preview a video that has multiple captions and audio tracks:**

1. In **[!UICONTROL Assets]**, navigate to an existing video that you have added multiple captions and audio tracks. 
1. Click the video asset so you can open it in preview mode.
1. On the preview page, near the upper-left corner of the page, select the drop-down list, then select **[!UICONTROL Viewers]**.

   ![Drop-down list showing the Viewers option.](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/msma-selectviewers.png)

1. From the Viewers list, select a viewer that you want to use for the video preview. As an example, the following screenshot shows the **[!UICONTROL Video]** viewer being selected.

   ![Selection of the Video viewer from the Viewers drop-down list.](/help/assets/dynamic-media/assets/msma-dmviewerselected.png)

1. Near the lower-right corner, to the left of the volume icon, select the speech bubble icon, then select the audio or caption you want to hear, or see or both. If desired, under Captions, you can disable the display of any captions by clicking **[!UICONTROL Off]**.

<!-- ## About AI-generated captions for videos in Dynamic Media

AI-powered captions in Dynamic Media are designed to enhance video accessibility and engagement by automatically generating accurate and synchronized subtitles. This technology uses advanced AI algorithms to transcribe spoken content into text, which is then displayed as captions on the video. Here are some key features.

* **Automatic Transcription:** The AI system transcribes spoken words from an existing audio file into text in real-time, ensuring that captions are generated quickly and accurately.
* **Multilingual Support:** It supports more than 60 languages, making it easier to reach a global audience. You can even translate your existing captions to different languages.
* **Enhanced Accessibility:** By providing captions, videos become more accessible to viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as those who prefer to watch videos with the sound off.
* **Improved Engagement:** Captions can help retain viewer attention and improve comprehension, especially in noisy environments or when the viewer's native language is different from the video's language.

These features in Dynamic Media make AI-powered video aptions a valuable tool for content creators looking to enhance their video content's accessibility and engagement. -->

## Add closed captions to video {#adding-captions-to-video}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe recommends that you [enable multiple caption and audio track capability](#enable-dash) on your Dynamic Media account. Doing so lets you take advantage of the latest Dynamic Media backend architecture and a simplified workflow for adding captions, captions, and audio tracks to your videos.

You can extend the reach of your videos to global markets by adding closed captioning to single videos or to Adaptive Video Sets. By adding closed captioning, you avoid the need to dub the audio, or the need to use native speakers to rerecord the audio for each different language. The video is played in the language that it was recorded. Foreign language captions appear so that people of different languages can still understand the audio portion.

Closed captioning also allows for greater accessibility for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The video player that you use must support the display of closed captions.

See also [Accessibility in Dynamic Media](/help/assets/dynamic-media/accessibility-dm.md).

Dynamic Media can convert caption files to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. This conversion means you can embed the JSON text into a web page as a hidden but complete transcript of the video. Search engines can then crawl/index the content to make the videos more easily discoverable and give customers more details about the video content.

See [Serving static (non-image) contents](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/image-serving-api/image-serving-api/c-serving-static-nonimage-contents#image-serving-api) for more information about using the JSON function in a URL.

**To add captions to a video:**

1. Use a third-party application or service to create your video caption file.

   Ensure the file that you create follows the WebVTT (Web Video Text Track) standard. The captioning filename extension is `.vtt`. You can learn more information about the WebVTT captioning standard.

   See [WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks format](https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/).

   There are many websites that offer both free and premium tools and services that you can use to author WebVTT caption files outside Dynamic Media. <!-- THE FOLLOWING LINK IS NO LONGER LIVE. CHECKED DECEMBER 13, 2023 For example, to create a simple video caption file with no styling, you can use the following free online caption authoring and editing tool: -->

   <!-- [WebVTT Caption Maker](https://testdrive-archive.azurewebsites.net/Graphics/CaptionMaker/Default.html)

   For best results, use the tool in Internet Explorer 9 or above, Google Chrome, or Safari.

   In the tool, in the **[!UICONTROL Enter URL of video file]** field, paste the copied URL of your video file and then select **[!UICONTROL Load]**. See [Obtain a URL for an Asset](/help/assets/dynamic-media/linking-urls-to-yourwebapplication.md#obtaining-a-url-for-an-asset) to get the URL to the video file itself which you can then paste into the **[!UICONTROL Enter URL of video file field]**. Internet Explorer, Chrome, or Safari can then natively play back the video.-->

  Follow the onscreen instructions from a site to author and save your WebVTT file. When you have finished, copy the caption file contents and paste it into a plain text editor and save it with a VTT filename extension.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >For global support of video captions in multiple languages, the WebVTT standard requires that you create separate `.vtt` files and calls for each language you want to support.

   Generally, you want to name the caption `.vtt` file the same name as the video file, and append it with the language locale, such as -EN, or -FR, or -DE. By doing so, it can help you with automating the generation of the video URLs using your existing WCM system.

1. In Experience Manager, upload your WebVTT caption file into DAM.
1. Navigate to the *published* video asset to associate it with the caption file that you uploaded.

   Remember that URLs are only available to copy *after* you have first *published* the assets.

   See [Publish assets](/help/assets/dynamic-media/publishing-dynamicmedia-assets.md).

1. Do one of the following:

    * For a pop-up video viewer experience, click the **[!UICONTROL URL]** button. In the URL dialog box, select and copy the URL to the Clipboard and then past the URL into a simple text editor. Append the copied URL of the video with the following syntax:

      `&caption=<server_path>/is/content/<path_to_caption.vtt_file,1>`

      Note the `,1` at the end of the caption path. Immediately following the VTT filename extension in the path, you can optionally enable (turn on) or disable (turn off) the closed caption button on the video player bar by setting to `,1` or `,0`, respectively.

    * For an embedded video viewer experience, select **[!UICONTROL Embed Code]**. In the Embed Code dialog box, select, and copy the embed code to the Clipboard and then paste the code into a simple text editor. Append the copied embed code with the following syntax:

      `videoViewer.setParam("caption","<path_to_caption.vtt_file,1>");`

      Note the `,1` at the end of the caption path. Immediately following the VTT filename extension in the path, you can optionally enable (turn on) or disable (turn off) the closed caption button on the video player bar by setting to `,1` or `,0`, respectively.

## Add chapter markers to video {#adding-chapter-markers-to-video}

You can make your long-form videos easier to watch and navigate by adding chapter markers to single videos or to Adaptive Video Sets. When a user plays the video, they can select the chapter markers on the video timeline (also known as the video scrubber). They can easily navigate to their point of interest, or immediately jump to new content, training, and demonstrations.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The video player that is used must support the use of chapter markers. Dynamic Media video players do support chapter markers but using third-party video players may not.

<!-- OBSOLETE CONTENT OBSOLETE CONTENT If desired, you can create and brand your own custom video viewer with chapters instead of using a video viewer preset. For instructions on creating your own HTML5 viewer with chapter navigation, in the Adobe Scene7 Viewer SDK for HTML5 guide, reference the heading "Customizing Behavior Using Modifiers" under the classes `s7sdk.video.VideoPlayer` and `s7sdk.video.VideoScrubber`. The Adobe Scene7 Viewer SDK is available as a download from [Adobe Developer Connection](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/scene7/using/WSef8d5860223939e2-43dedf7012b792fc1d5-8000.html). -->

You create a chapter list for your video in much the same way that you create captions. That is, you create a WebVTT file. Note, however, that this file must be separate from any WebVTT caption file. You cannot combine captions and chapters into one WebVTT file.

You can use the following sample as an example of the format you use to create a WebVTT file with chapter navigation:

### WebVTT file with video chapter navigation {#webvtt-file-with-video-chapter-navigation}

```xml {.line-numbers}
WEBVTT
Chapter 1
00:00.000 --> 01:04.364
The bicycle store behind it all.
Chapter 2
01:04.364 --> 02:00.944
Creative Cloud.
Chapter 3
02:00.944 --> 03:02.937
Ease of management for a working solution.
Chapter 4
03:02.937 --> 03:35.000
Cost-efficient access to rapidly evolving technology.
```

In the example above, `Chapter 1` is the cue identifier and is optional. The cue time of `00:00:000 --> 01:04:364` specifies the start time and end time of the chapter, in `00:00:000` format. That last three digits are milliseconds and can be left as `000`, if preferred. The chapter title of `The bicycle store behind it all` is the actual description of the chapter's contents. The cue identifier, the starting cue time, and the chapter title all appear in a pop-up in the video player when a user hovers their mouse pointer over a visual cue point in the timeline.

Because you are using an HTML5 video viewer, ensure that the chapter file you create follows the WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) standard. The chapter filename extension is `.vtt`. You can learn more information about the WebVTT captioning standard.

See [WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks format](https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/).

**To add chapter markers to a video:**

1. Save the `.vtt` file in UTF8 encoding so you avoid problems with character rendition in the chapter title text.

   Generally, you want to name the chapter VTT file the same name as the video file, and append it with chapters. By doing so, it can help you with automating the generation of the video URLs using your existing WCM system.
1. In Experience Manager, upload your WebVTT chapter file.

   See [Upload assets](/help/assets/manage-digital-assets.md#uploading-assets).

1. Do one of the following:

## About video thumbnails {#about-video-thumbnails}

A video thumbnail is a reduced-size version of a video frame or an image asset representing the video to the customer. The thumbnail should serve to encourage a customer to select the video.

All videos in Experience Manager must have an associated thumbnail. By default, when you upload a video to Experience Manager, the first frame is used as the thumbnail. However, you can customize the thumbnail for branding purposes or visual search. When you customize a video thumbnail, you can play the video and pause on the frame you want to use. Or, you can select an image asset that you have already uploaded and *published* in your digital asset manager.

When the thumbnail is changed for a video, thumbnail generation by way of Asset Compute Service on reprocessing the video is skipped.  

The ability to customize a video thumbnail is only available after you have applied a video profile to the folder where the video is located.

### Adding a custom video thumbnail {#adding-a-custom-video-thumbnail}

1. Be sure you have already done the following:

    * Created a folder for your video assets.
    * [Applied a video profile to the folder](/help/assets/dynamic-media/video-profiles.md#applying-a-video-profile-to-folders).

    * [Uploaded your videos to the folder](/help/assets/manage-video-assets.md#upload-and-preview-video-assets).

1. Navigate to an uploaded video asset whose thumbnail image you want to change.
1. In asset selection mode either from **[!UICONTROL List View]** or **[!UICONTROL Card View]**, select the video asset.
1. On the toolbar, select the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** icon (a circle with an "i" in it).
1. On the video's Properties page, select **[!UICONTROL Change Thumbnail]**.
1. On the Change Thumbnail page, do one of the following:

    * To use a frame from the video as the new thumbnail:

        * On the toolbar, click the **[!UICONTROL Select Frame from video]** option.
        * Select the Play button, then select the Pause button on the frame you want to capture as the video's new thumbnail.

    * To use an image asset as the new thumbnail:

        * On the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Select Thumbnail from Assets]**.
        * Select **[!UICONTROL Select Thumbnail]**.
        * Navigate to a previously uploaded and published image asset that you want to use. The asset is automatically resized to serve as a thumbnail image for the video.
        * Select the image asset, then select **[!UICONTROL Select]**.

1. On the Change Thumbnail page, select **[!UICONTROL Save Change]**.
1. On the video's Properties page, in the upper-right corner, select **[!UICONTROL Save & Close]**.

## About video thumbnails in Dynamic Media Hybrid mode{#about-video-thumbnails-in-dynamic-media-hybrid-mode}

You can choose from one of ten thumbnail images automatically generated by Dynamic Media to add to your video. The video player displays your selected thumbnail when a video asset is used with the Dynamic Media component in the authoring environment of Experience Manager Sites, Experience Manager Mobile, or Experience Manager Screens. The thumbnail serves as a static picture that best represents the contents of your entire video and further encourages users to select the Play button.

Based on the total time of the video, Dynamic Media captures ten (default) thumbnail images at 1%, 11%, 21%, 31%, 41%, 51%, 61%, 71%, 81%, and 91% into the video. The ten thumbnails persist meaning that if you decide to choose a different thumbnail later on, you do not need to regenerate the series. You preview the ten thumbnail images and then select the one you want to use with your video. If you want to change to default you can use CRXDE Lite to configure the time interval that thumbnail images are generated. For example, if you only wanted to generate a series of four evenly spaced thumbnail images from your video, you can configure the interval time at 24%, 49%, 74%, and 99%.

Ideally, you can add a video thumbnail anytime after you upload your video but before you publish the video on your website.

If you prefer, you can choose to upload a custom thumbnail to represent your video instead of using a thumbnail generated by Dynamic Media. For example, you could create a custom thumbnail image that has the title of your video, an eye-catching opening image, or a very specific image captured from your video. The custom video thumbnail image that you upload should have a maximum resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels (minimum width of 640 pixels) and be no larger than 2MB.

## Change the Dynamic Media URL for Dynamic Media assets

Out-of-the-box viewers can play videos processed in Dynamic Media. You can also play them by directly accessing the manifest URLs and using your own custom viewers. The following is the API for fetching manifest URLs for a video. 

### About the getVideoManifestURI API

The `getVideoManifestURI`API is exposed through c`q-scene7-api:com.day.cq.dam.scene7.api` and can be used to generate the following manifest URLs: 
 
``` java
/**   
* Returns the manifest url for videos 
* @param resource video resource 
* @param manifestType type of video streaming manifest being requested 
* @param onlyIfPublished return a manifest only if the video is published 
* @return the manifest url for videos 
* 
* @throws Exception 
*/
@Nullable 
String getVideoManifestURI(Resource resource, ManifestType manifestType, boolean onlyIfPublished) throws Exception;
```

#### getVideoManifestURI API parameters 

This API takes in the following three parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `resource` | The resource corresponding to the video that Dynamic Media has ingested.|
| `manifestType` | Can be either `ManifestType.DASH` or `ManifestType.HLS`|
| `onlyIfPublished` | Set to true in case the manifest uri is generated only if it is published and available on the delivery tier.|

To fetch the manifest URLs for videos using the method above, add a [video encoding profile](/help/assets/dynamic-media/video-profiles.md#creating-a-video-encoding-profile-for-adaptive-streaming) to an "upload videos" folder. Dynamic Media processes these videos based on the encodings found in the video encoding file that was assigned to the folder. Now, you can invoke the above API for fetching manifest URLs for the uploaded videos. 

### Error scenarios 

The API returns null if there are errors. Exceptions are logged in Experience Manager error logs. All such logged errors start with `Could not generate Video Manifest URI`. The following scenarios can make such errors occur: 

* An `IllegalArgumentException` gets logged for any of the following: 

    * The `resource` parameter passed is null.
    * The `resource` parameter passed is not a video.
    * The `manifestType` parameter passed is null.
    * The `onlyIfPublished` parameter is passed as true, but the video is not published. 
    * The video was not ingested using an Adaptive Video Set from Dynamic Media.

*   `IOException` gets logged when there is an issue connecting to Dynamic Media. 
*   `UnsupportedOperationException` gets logged when a `manifestType` parameter passed is `ManifestType.DASH`, while the video has not been processed using DASH format. 

<!-- THE REMAINING SECTION IS FOR 6.5 ONLY

### Use the sample servlet

You invoke the servlet by performing a `GET` operation at `/dmSample/dynamicmedia/video/manifestUrl`. The following query parameters are passed: 

| Query parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `assetPath` | Mandatory. The path to the video for which `manifestUrl` is generated. |
| `manifestType` | Optional. Parameter can be DASH or HLS. If it is not passed, it defaults to DASH. |
| `onlyIfPublished` | Optional. If passed, the `manifestUrl` is returned only if the video is published.  |

In this example, let us assume the following setup: 

* The company is `samplecompany`.
* The authoring instance is `http://sample-aem-author.com`.
* The folder `/content/dam/video-example` has a video encoding profile applied to it. 
* The video `scenery.mp4` is uploaded to the folder `/content/dam/video-example`.

You can invoke the servlet in following ways: 
     
| Type | Description |
| :--- | --- |
| HLS | `http://sample-aem-author.com/dmSample/dynamicmedia/video/manifestUrl?manifestType=HLS&assetPath=/content/dam/video-example/scenery.mp4`<br><br>In case DASH delivery is enabled:<br>`{"manifestUrl":"https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/content/samplecompany/scenery-AVS.m3u8?packagedStreaming=true"}`<br><br>In case DASH delivery is disabled:<br>`{"manifestUrl":"https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/content/samplecompany/scenery-AVS.m3u8"}` |
| DASH | `http://sample-aem-author.com/dmSample/dynamicmedia/video/manifestUrl?manifestType=DASH&assetPath=/content/dam/video-example/scenery.mp4`<br><br>In case DASH delivery is enabled:<br>`{"manifestUrl":"https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/content/samplecompany/scenery-AVS.mpd"}`<br><br>In case DASH delivery is disabled:<br>`{}` |
| Error: asset path is wrong | `http://sample-aem-author.com/dmSample/dynamicmedia/video/manifestUrl?manifestType=DASH&assetPath=/content/dam/video-example/scennnnnnery.mp4`<br><br>`{"errorString":"could not retrieve the resource from JCR"}` |
