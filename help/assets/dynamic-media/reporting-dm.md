# Request an error report for Dynamic Media delivery URLs that fail

You can now request an error report that identifies Dynamic Media URLs that failed at delivery time. The report is an aggregation of data over five days and is available in a CSV format. The error report includes the following information:

* Failed Dynamic Media delivery URL &ndash; A failing URL is a Dynamic Media-generated URL that is not able to produce any content at the time of delivery.
* Referrer URL &ndash; The referrer URL from which the failed delivery URL is called.
* Failure count &ndash; The number of times the delivery URL was loaded that resulted in a failure.

When you request the error report, the Adobe Dynamic Media team emails the report to you, in CSV format. It covers a five-day period from the day that your request was made.

You can request an error report once a month, for a given company.
