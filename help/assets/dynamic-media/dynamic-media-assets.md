# Working with Dynamic Media{#working-with-dynamic-media}

[Dynamic Media](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management/dynamic-media.html) helps deliver rich visual merchandising and marketing assets on demand, automatically scaled for consumption on web, mobile, and social sites. Using a set of master assets, Dynamic Media generates and delivers multiple variations of rich content in real time through its global, scalable, performance-optimized network.

Dynamic media serves interactive viewing experiences, including zoom, 360-degree spin, and video. Dynamic media uniquely incorporates the workflows of the Adobe Experience Manager digital asset management (Assets) solution to simplify and streamline the digital campaign management process.

Working with Dynamic Media is not available in the classic UI. See [Working with Dynamic Media,](/help/assets/dynamic-media/dynamic-media.md) which covers the touch-enabled user interface.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are using Dynamic Media, you cannot simultaneously use automatic uploads available if you have [integrated Dynamic Media Classic into AEM](/help/sites-cloud/administering/integrating-scene7.md). Dynamic Media is disabled by default.
