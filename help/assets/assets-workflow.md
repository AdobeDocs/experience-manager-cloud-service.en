# Apply workflows to assets {#applying-workflows-to-assets}

You use workflows in digital assets to activate the asset or create watermarks. Some of the workflows for assets are configured to execute automatically based on certain conditions. For example, the workflow that automatically creates a rendition is automatically executed after an image is edited.

## Apply a workflow to an AEM asset {#apply-a-workflow-to-an-aem-asset}

For more information, see [start a workflow on an asset](/help/assets/manage-digital-assets.md#starting-a-workflow-on-an-asset).

To apply a workflow to multiple assets, follow these steps:

1. From the Assets console, navigate to the location of the assets for which you want to start a workflow, and select the assets.
1. Click the AEM icon and choose **[!UICONTROL Timeline]** from the menu to display the timeline.
1. Click the Actions icon at the bottom.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Start Workflow]**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Start Workflow]** dialog, select a workflow model from the list.
1. (Optional) Specify a title for the workflow, which can be used to reference the workflow instance.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Start]** and then click **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** in the dialog. The workflow runs on all the assets you selected.

## Apply a workflow to multiple folders {#applying-a-workflow-to-multiple-folders}

The procedure to apply a workflow to multiple folders is similar to the procedure to apply a workflow to multiple assets. Select the folders in the Assets console and follow the above steps.

## Apply a workflow to a collection {#applying-a-workflow-to-a-collection}

For more information, see [how to apply a workflow on a collection](/help/assets/manage-collections.md#run-a-workflow-on-a-collection).
