# Configure asset upload restrictions {#configure-asset-upload-restrictions}

You can configure Adobe Experience Manager Assets to restrict the type of assets that users can upload based on the MIME type. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>By default, Experience Manager Assets allows users to upload assets of all MIME types. However, you can configure the settings to restrict users to upload files of specific MIME types only.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites-asset-upload-restrictions}

You must have administrator privileges to configure asset upload restrictions.

## Apply restrictions for asset uploads {#apply-restrictions-asset-uploadsssssss}

To configure [!DNL Experience Manager] to restrict users to upload files of specific MIME types:

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools > Assets > Assets Configurations]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Upload Restrictions]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** to define the allowed MIME types.

1. Specify the MIME type in the text box. You can click **[!UICONTROL Add]** again to specify more allowed MIME types. You can also click ![delete icon](assets/delete-icon.svg) to delete any MIME type from the list.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

**Example 1: Allow upload of all images and PDF files to Experience Manager Assets**

To allow the upload of images in all formats and PDF files to Experience Manager Assets, do the following settings:

   ![Asset upload restrictions](assets/asset-upload-restrictions.png)

`image/*` as the MIME type allows the upload of images in all formats. `application/pdf` as the MIME type allows the upload of PDF files to Experience Manager Assets.

If you attempt to upload a file that is not included in the list of allowed MIME types, Experience Manager Assets displays the following error message:

   ![Restricted files](assets/asset-upload-restricted-files.png)

`Screen Recording 2022-08-31 at 3.36.09 PM.mov` refers to a file name that is not included in the allowed MIME types.

**Example 2: Allow upload of specific image formats to Experience Manager Assets**

To add specific image formats to the allowed MIME types and to restrict uploading all other asset formats, do the following settings:

![Asset restrictions](assets/asset-restrictions.png)

Based on the settings depicted in the image, you can upload images in .JPG, .PNG, and .GIF formats to Experience Manager Assets.
