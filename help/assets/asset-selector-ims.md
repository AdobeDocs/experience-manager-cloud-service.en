# Integrate Asset Selector with an [!DNL Adobe] application {#adobe-app-integration-vanilla}

This example demonstrates the usage of Asset Selector when running an [!DNL Adobe] application under Unified Shell or when you already have `imsToken` generated for authentication.

Include the Asset Selector package in your code using the `script` tag, as shown in _lines 6&ndash;15_ of the example below. Once the script is loaded, the `PureJSSelectors` global variable is available for use. Define the Asset Selector [properties](#asset-selector-properties) as shown in _lines 16&ndash;23_. The `imsOrg` and `imsToken` properties are both required for authentication in Adobe application. The `handleSelection` property is used to handle the selected assets. To render the Asset Selector, call the `renderAssetSelector` function as mentioned in _line 17_. The Asset Selector is displayed in the `<div>` container element, as shown in _lines 21 and 22_.

By following these steps, you can use Asset Selector with your [!DNL Adobe] application.

```html {line-numbers="true"}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Asset Selector</title>
    <script src="https://experience.adobe.com/solutions/CQ-assets-selectors/assets/resources/assets-selectors.js"></script>
    <script>
        // get the container element in which we want to render the AssetSelector component
        const container = document.getElementById('asset-selector-container');
        // imsOrg and imsToken are required for authentication in Adobe application
        const assetSelectorProps = {
            imsOrg: 'example-ims@AdobeOrg',
            imsToken: "example-imsToken",
            apiKey: "example-apiKey-associated-with-imsOrg",
            handleSelection: (assets: SelectedAssetType[]) => {},
        };
        // Call the `renderAssetSelector` available in PureJSSelectors globals to render AssetSelector
        PureJSSelectors.renderAssetSelector(container, assetSelectorProps);
    </script>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="asset-selector-container" style="height: calc(100vh - 80px); width: calc(100vw - 60px); margin: -20px;">
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

## ImsAuthProps {#ims-auth-props}

The `ImsAuthProps` properties define the authentication information and flow that the Asset Selector uses to obtain an `imsToken`. By setting these properties, you can control how the authentication flow should behave and register listeners for various authentication events.

| Property Name | Description|
|---|---|
| `imsClientId`| A string value representing the IMS client ID used for authentication purposes. This value is provided by Adobe and is specific to your Adobe AEM CS organization.|
| `imsScope`| Describes the scopes used in authentication. The scopes determine the level of access that the application has to your organization resources. Multiple scopes can be separated by commas.|
| `redirectUrl` | Represents the URL where the user is redirected after authentication. This value is typically set to the current URL of the application. If a `redirectUrl` is not supplied, `ImsAuthService` will use the redirectUrl used to register the `imsClientId`|
| `modalMode`| A boolean indicating whether the authentication flow should be displayed in a modal (pop-up) or not. If set to `true`, the authentication flow is displayed in a pop-up. If set to `false`, the authentication flow is displayed in a full page reload. _Note:_ for better UX, you can dynamically control this value if the user has browser pop-up disabled. |
| `onImsServiceInitialized`| A callback function that is called when the Adobe IMS authentication service is initialized. This function takes one parameter, `service`, which is an object representing the Adobe IMS service. See [`ImsAuthService`](#imsauthservice-ims-auth-service) for more details.|
| `onAccessTokenReceived`| A callback function that is called when an `imsToken` is received from the Adobe IMS authentication service. This function takes one parameter, `imsToken`, which is a string representing the access token. |
| `onAccessTokenExpired`| A callback function that is called when an access token has expired. This function is typically used to trigger a new authentication flow to obtain a new access token. |
| `onErrorReceived`| A callback function that is called when an error occurs during authentication. This function takes two parameters: the error type and error message. The error type is a string representing the type of error and the error message is a string representing the error message. |

## ImsAuthService {#ims-auth-service}

`ImsAuthService` class handles the authentication flow for the Asset Selector. It is responsible for obtaining an `imsToken` from the Adobe IMS authentication service. The `imsToken` is used to authenticate the user and authorize access to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] Assets repository. ImsAuthService uses the `ImsAuthProps` properties to control the authentication flow and register listeners for various authentication events. You can use the convenient [`registerAssetsSelectorsAuthService`](#purejsselectorsregisterassetsselectorsauthservice) function to register the _ImsAuthService_ instance with the Asset Selector. The following functions are available on the `ImsAuthService` class. However, if you are using the _registerAssetsSelectorsAuthService_ function, you do not need to call these functions directly.

| Function Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `isSignedInUser` | Determines whether the user is currently signed in to the service and returns a boolean value accordingly.|
| `getImsToken`    | Retrieves the authentication `imsToken` for the currently signed-in user, which can be used to authenticate requests to other services such as generating asset _rendition.|
| `signIn`| Initiates the sign-in process for the user. This function uses the `ImsAuthProps` to show authentication in either a pop-up or a full page reload |
| `signOut`| Signs the user out of the service, invalidating their authentication token and requiring them to sign in again to access protected resources. Invoking this function will reload the current page.|
| `refreshToken`| Refreshes the authentication token for the currently signed-in user, preventing it from expiring and ensuring uninterrupted access to protected resources. Returns a new authentication token that can be used for subsequent requests. |
