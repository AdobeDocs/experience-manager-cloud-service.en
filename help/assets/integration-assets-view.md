# Integration with other Adobe solutions {#integrations}

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials] integrates well with the supported Adobe solutions and provides an embedded experience from within the interfaces of these applications. It lets users use the basic assets functionality from within the native application or interface, without having to leave their familiar applications.

The embedded [!DNL Assets Essentials] experience can integrate with the following solutions:

* **[!DNL Creative Cloud for Enterprise]**: [Adobe Asset Link in-app panel](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/business/enterprise/adobe-asset-link.html) lets creative professionals connect to [!DNL Assets Essentials] repository from within the supported [!DNL Adobe Creative Cloud] desktop apps. The panel is available for [!DNL Adobe Photoshop], [!DNL Adobe Illustrator], [!DNL Adobe InDesign], and [!DNL Adobe XD]. It streamlines the access to assets that in turn increases content velocity. See [manage assets using [!DNL Adobe Asset Link]](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-assets-using-adobe-asset-link.html).
