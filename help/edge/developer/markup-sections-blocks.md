description: To design websites and create functionality, developers use the markup and DOM that is rendered dynamically from the content. The markup and DOM are constructed in a way that allows flexible manipulation and styling. At the same time it provides out-of-the-box functionality so the developer does not have to worry about some of the aspects of modern websites.
