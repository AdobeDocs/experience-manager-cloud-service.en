# Prepare your spreadsheet to accept data 

![Document-based authoring ecosystem](/help/edge/assets/document-based-authoring-workflow-enable-sheet-to-accept-data.png)

Once you've [created and previewed the form](/help/edge/docs/forms/create-forms.md), it's time to enable the corresponding spreadsheet to start receiving data. 


<!-- 
>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3427489?quality=12&learn=on)

-->

To enable the spreadsheet: 

1. Open the spreadsheet that has your form and append a new sheet, renaming it to `incoming`.

    >[!WARNING] 
    >
    > If the `incoming` sheet is not present, AEM does not send any data to the spreadsheet.

1. Mirror the form field names, values of the `Name` column in the`shared-default` sheet, to the headers in the `incoming` sheet. 

    Each value in the `Name` column of the `shared-default` sheet, excluding the submit button, serve as a header in the `incoming` sheet. For instance, consider the following image illustrating headers for a "contact-us" form:

    ![Fields for a contact-us form](/help/edge/assets/contact-us-form-excel-sheet-fields.png)

1. Use sidekick to preview the sheet.

    >[!NOTE] 
    >
    >Even if you have previewed the sheet before, you must preview it again after creating the `incoming` sheet for the first time.


Once the field names are added to the `incoming` sheet, your form becomes ready to accept submissions. You can preview the form and submit data to the sheet using it. 


You also observe the following changes in your spreadsheet: 

A sheet named "Slack" is added to your Excel Workbook or Google Sheet. In this sheet, you can configure automatic notifications for a designated Slack channel whenever new data is ingested into your spreadsheet. At present, AEM supports notifications exclusively to the AEM Engineering Slack organization and the Adobe Enterprise Support organization.

1. To set up Slack notifications enter the "teamId" of the Slack workspace and the "channel name" or "ID". You can also ask the slack-bot (with the debug command) for the "teamId" and the "channel ID". Using the "channel ID" instead of the "channel name" is preferable, as it survives channel renames.

    >[!NOTE] 
    >
    > Older forms didn't have the "teamId" column. The "teamId" was included in the channel column, separated by a "#" or "/".

1. Enter any title that you want and under fields enter the names of the fields you want to see in the Slack notification. Each heading should be separated by a comma (For example name, email).

    >[!WARNING] 
    >
    >  Never should the "shared-default" sheets contain any personally identifiable information or sensitive data that you are not comfortable with being publicly accessible.


## (Optional) Use Admin APIs to enable a spreadsheet to accept data

You can also send a POST request to the form to enable it to accept data and configure headers for the `incoming` sheet. Upon receiving the POST request, the service analyzes the body of request and autonomously generates the essential headers and sheets needed for data ingestion.

To use Admin APIs to enable a spreadsheet to accept data: 


1. Open the workbook that you have created and change the name of the default sheet to `incoming`. 

    >[!WARNING] 
    >
    > If the `incoming` sheet doesn't exist, AEM won't send any data to this workbook.

1. Preview the sheet in the sidekick.

    >[!NOTE] 
    >
    >Even if you have previewed the sheet before, you must preview it again after creating the `incoming` sheet for the first time.

1. Send the POST request to generate the appropriate headers in the `incoming` sheet, and add the `shared-default` sheets to your spread sheet, if it does not exist already.

    To understand how to format the POST request for setting up your sheet, refer to the [Admin API documentation](https://www.aem.live/docs/admin.html#tag/authentication/operation/profile). You can look at the example provided below: 

    **Request** 
    
    ```JSON

    POST 'https://admin.hlx.page/form/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/contact-us.json' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "data": {
            "Email": "john@wknd.com",
            "Name": "John",
            "Subject": "Regarding Product Inquiry",
            "Message": "I have some questions about your products.",
            "Phone": "123-456-7890",
            "Company": "Adobe Inc.",
            "Country": "United States",
            "PreferredContactMethod": "Email",
            "SubscribeToNewsletter": true
        }
    }'

    ```


    **Response**

    ```JSON

    HTTP/2 200 
    content-type: application/json
    x-invocation-id: 1b3bd30a-8cfb-4f85-a662-4b1f7cf367c5
    cache-control: no-store, private, must-revalidate
    accept-ranges: bytes
    date: Sat, 10 Feb 2024 09:26:48 GMT
    via: 1.1 varnish
    x-served-by: cache-del21736-DEL
    x-cache: MISS
    x-cache-hits: 0
    x-timer: S1707557205.094883,VS0,VE3799

    content-length: 138

    {"rowCount":2,"columns":["Email","Name","Subject","Message","Phone","Company","Country",      "PreferredContactMethod","SubscribeToNewsletter"]}%

    ```

    You can use tools like curl or Postman to execute this POST request, as demonstrated below:

    ```JSON

    curl -s -i -X POST 'https://admin.hlx.page/form/wkndforms/portal/main/contact-us.json' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
            "data": {
                "Email": "john@wknd.com",
                "Name": "John",
                "Subject": "Regarding Product Inquiry",
                "Message": "I have some questions about your products.",
                "Phone": "123-456-7890",
                "Company": "Wknd Inc.",
                "Country": "United States",
                "PreferredContactMethod": "Email",
                "SubscribeToNewsletter": true
        }
    }'

    ```

    The above mentioned POST request provides sample data, including both form fields and their respective sample values. This data is used by the Admin service to set up the form.

    Your form is now enabled to accept data. You also observe the following changes in your spreadsheet: 

A sheet named "Slack" is added to your Excel Workbook or Google Sheet. In this sheet, you can configure automatic notifications for a designated Slack channel whenever new data is ingested into your spreadsheet. At present, AEM supports notifications exclusively to the AEM Engineering Slack organization and the Adobe Enterprise Support organization.

1. To set up Slack notifications enter the "teamId" of the Slack workspace and the "channel name" or "ID". You can also ask the slack-bot (with the debug command) for the "teamId" and the "channel ID". Using the "channel ID" instead of the "channel name" is preferable, as it survives channel renames.

    >[!NOTE] 
    >
    > Older forms didn't have the "teamId" column. The "teamId" was included in the channel column, separated by a "#" or "/".

1. Enter any title that you want and under fields enter the names of the fields you want to see in the Slack notification. Each heading should be separated by a comma (For example name, email).


The sheet is now set up to receive data, you can [preview the form using Adaptive Form Block](/help/edge/docs/forms/create-forms.md#preview-the-form-using-your-edge-delivery-service-eds-page) or [use POST requests](#use-admin-apis-to-send-data-to-your-sheet) to start sending data to the sheet.

 >[!WARNING] 
 >
 >  Never should the "shared-default" sheets contain any personally identifiable information or sensitive data that you are not comfortable with being publicly accessible.

## Send data to your sheet {#send-data-to-your-sheet}

After the sheet is set to receive data, you can [preview the form using Adaptive Form Block](/help/edge/docs/forms/create-forms.md#preview-the-form-using-your-edge-delivery-service-eds-page) or [use Admin APIs](#use-admin-apis-to-send-data-to-your-sheet) to start sending data to the sheet.

### Use Admin APIs to send data to your sheet

You can send POST requests directly to your form using hlx.page, hlx.live, or your production domain, to send data. 


```JSON

POST https://branch–repo–owner.hlx.(page|live)/email-form
POST https://my-domain.com/email-form

```

>[!NOTE] 
>
> The URL should not have the .json extension. You must publish the sheet for POST operations to function on `.live` or on the production domain.

#### Formatting the form data

There are a few different ways that you can format the form data in the POST body. You can use: 

* array of `name:value` pairs: 
    
    ```JSON
    
    {
      "data": [
        { "name": "name", "value": "Clark Kent" },
        { "name": "email", "value": "superman@example.com" },
        { "name": "subject", "value": "Regarding Product Inquiry" },
        { "name": "message", "value": "I have some questions about your products." },
        { "name": "phone", "value": "123-456-7890" },
        { "name": "company", "value": "Example Inc." },
        { "name": "country", "value": "United States" },
        { "name": "preferred_contact_method", "value": "Email" },
        { "name": "newsletter_subscribe", "value": true }
      ]
    }

    ```

    For example

    ```JSON

    curl -s -i -X POST 'https://main--portal--wkndforms.hlx.page/contact-us' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
        "data": [
            { "name": "name", "value": "Clark Kent" },
            { "name": "email", "value": "superman@example.com" },
            { "name": "subject", "value": "Regarding Product Inquiry" },
            { "name": "message", "value": "I have some questions about your        products." },
            { "name": "phone", "value": "123-456-7890" },
            { "name": "company", "value": "Example Inc." },
            { "name": "country", "value": "United States" },
            { "name": "preferred_contact_method", "value": "Email" },
            { "name": "newsletter_subscribe", "value": true }
        ]
    }'

    ```



* an object with `key:value` pairs:

    ```JSON

        {
          "data": {
            "name": "Jessica Jones",
            "email": "jj@example.com",
            "subject": "Regarding Product Inquiry",
            "message": "I have some questions about your products.",
            "phone": "123-456-7890",
            "company": "Example Inc.",
            "country": "United States",
            "preferred_contact_method": "Email",
            "newsletter_subscribe": true
          }
        }

    ```

    For example,

    ```JSON

    curl -s -i -X POST 'https://admin.hlx.page/form/wkndforms/portal/main/contact-us.json' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "data": {
            "Email": "khushwant@wknd.com",
            "Name": "khushwant",
            "Subject": "Regarding Product Inquiry",
            "Message": "I have some questions about your products.",
            "Phone": "123-456-7890",
            "Company": "Adobe Inc.",
            "Country": "United States",
            "PreferredContactMethod": "Email",
            "SubscribeToNewsletter": true
        }
    }'

    ```

* URL encoded (`x-www-form-urlencoded`) body (with `content-type` header set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)

    ```Shell

    'Email=kent%40wknd.com&Name=clark&Subject=Regarding+Product+Inquiry&Message=I   +have+some+questions+about+your+products.&Phone=123-456-7890&Company=Adobe+Inc.&   Country=United+States&PreferredContactMethod=Email&SubscribeToNewsletter=true'

    ```

    For example,

    ```Shell

    curl -s -i -X POST \
      -d 'Email=kent%40wknd.com&Name=clark&Subject=Regarding+Product+Inquiry&   Message=I+have+some+questions+about+your+products.&Phone=123-456-7890& Company=Adobe+Inc.&Country=United+States&PreferredContactMethod=Email&   SubscribeToNewsletter=true' \
      https://main--portal--wkndforms.hlx.live/contact-us

    ```

Next, you can customize the thank you message, [configure a thank you page](/help/edge/docs/forms/thank-you-page-form.md), or [set redirects](/help/edge/docs/forms/thank-you-page-form.md).
