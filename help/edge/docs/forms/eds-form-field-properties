# Adaptive Form block Field Properties

Each form field is represented as a dedicated row in the spreadsheet, analogous to fields in a database table. The column headers act as labels for the various properties supported by the form field block.

Think of your form as a table in a spreadsheet, where each line represents a different question or piece of information you want to collect. The table headings tell you what kind of answers you can expect for each section.

The below table lists all the properties that are supported by the Form Block.
