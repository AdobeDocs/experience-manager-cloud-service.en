# Exploring the Universal Editor (WYSIWYG) Interface

The [Universal Editor](/help/edge/docs/forms/universal-editor/overview-universal-editor-for-edge-delivery-services-for-forms.md) offers a simple, visual, and intuitive What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) interface for Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS) Forms. It provides a modern interface with drag-and-drop functionality for efficient form authoring. 

![Universal Editor User Interface](/help/edge/docs/forms/universal-editor/assets/universal-editor-interface.png)

## Understanding Universal Editor Interface

When the form author edits the form using the Universal Editor, the console opens an interactive WYSIWYG interface, allowing the user to start editing the form.

> To learn how to author forms using the Universal Editor, see the article [Getting Started with Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms using Universal Editor (WYSIWYG)](/help/edge/docs/forms/universal-editor/getting-started-universal-editor.md).

![Universal Editor User Interface](/help/edge/docs/forms/universal-editor/assets/universal-editor-interface1.png)

The Universal Editor interface is divided into four parts:

* **[D: Editor](#editor)**

### Experience Cloud Header

The Experience Cloud header is located at the top of the console. It provides information about the current location within Experience Cloud. It also allows you to navigate to other Experience Cloud applications.
