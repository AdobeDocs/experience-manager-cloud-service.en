<!-- ![Universal Editor](/help/edge/docs/forms/universal-editor/assets/generate-forms.svg)  **WYSIWYG interface for Form creation**: Universal Editor provides a WYSIWYG interface for form design. It provides pre-built component library, responsive design support, and template-based form creation. You can instantly add or remove form fields and modify field properties (like label, data binding, validation). You can also plugin custom form components to Universal Editor.


* **Rule editor**: The rule editor stands out as a powerful mechanism for creating sophisticated form interactions. It supports event-driven rules, instant validation, and error handling through lightweight JavaScript and JSON-based definitions. This allows developers to implement complex form logic, such as conditional field visibility, automatic calculations, and dynamic form behaviour without extensive coding.

* **Submit actions**: Submit Actions enable form submission workflows. These actions provide comprehensive backend integration options, supporting protocols like REST API. The system allows you configure data pre-processors for automatic data transformation, conditional submission logic based on form field values, and secure endpoint connections. Organizations can define complex submission rules that validate data, and manage form responses with granular control.

* **Pre-fill services:** Pre-fill Services enhance user experience by intelligently populating form fields with relevant data. These services connect to various data sources, including user profiles, browser local storage, and external databases. The mechanism supports dynamic data population, enabling automatic completion of form fields based on contextual information. Users benefit from reduced manual data entry, while administrators gain flexibility in configuring pre-fill rules across different form types and scenarios. The pre-fill functionality adapts to different authentication methods, including session-based approaches and token-based systems, ensuring both convenience and security.

* **Data binding capabilities**: Data binding in the Universal Editor enables direct, dynamic connections between form fields and backend data sources. This feature allows real-time synchronization of form data, supporting complex data mapping scenarios. The system supports transforming form inputs into structured database records with minimal configuration. Advanced mapping supports nested data structures, allowing complex form designs to interact seamlessly with intricate data models.

* **Internationalization/localization capabilities**: Internationalization support ensures global accessibility, with multi-language rendering, right-to-left language compatibility, and locale-specific formatting.

* **Analytics and tracking mechanisms**: The built-in analytics and tracking mechanisms provide comprehensive insights into form interactions, submission rates, and user behavior, enabling continuous optimization of form design and performance. 

* **Experimentation (A/B Testing)**: The Universal Editor supports experimentation by allowing organizations to run A/B tests on form designs to identify the best-performing layouts or features.

* **Task Management via Adobe Workfront**: Integration with Adobe Workfront allows teams to manage tasks related to form creation and maintenance, ensuring streamlined collaboration and efficient workflows.

* **Hidden Fields**: Hidden fields store data invisibly within the form, often for backend processing or prefilled values. Use cases include:
    * Passing contextual information (e.g., user ID or session data) to the backend without displaying it to users.
    * Capturing metadata like timestamps or tracking IDs.
    * Hidden fields are not visible to end-users but can be prefilled, updated dynamically, or used in workflows.
