# Use reCAPTCHA in WYSIWYG authoring

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a popular tool used to protect websites from fraudulent activities, spam, and misuse. 

For example, consider a form that collects data such as start and end trip dates, room budget, estimated trip cost, and traveler information. In such cases, there is a risk of malicious users exploiting the form for purposes like sending phishing emails or flooding it with irrelevant or harmful content using spambots. Integrating CAPTCHA offers added security by verifying that submissions are from genuine users, effectively minimizing spam entries.
