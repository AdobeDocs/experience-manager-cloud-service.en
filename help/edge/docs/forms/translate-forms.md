## Translate forms within Google Drive {#translate-form-google-drive}

The `GOOGLETRANSLATE` function at Google sheets translates forms by tapping into built-in translation tool, changing text from one language to another directly within a Google sheet. To translate forms within Google Drive:

1. Go to your AEM Project folder on Google Drive and open your Google sheet. 
2. Rename the existing sheet (`shared-default`) to `shared-en`.
3. Add a sheet named `shared-default`. The `shared-default` sheet contains the content for localization to a specific language.
4. Add the  localized content in the `shared-default` sheet using the `GOOGLETRANSLATE` function. 
   You can use a formula to translate the content of cell D2 from the `shared-en` sheet into French within the `shared-default` sheet. Here is the formula to use:
   `=GOOGLETRANSLATE('shared-en'!D2,"en","fr")`
