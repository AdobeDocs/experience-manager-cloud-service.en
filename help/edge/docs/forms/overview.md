![Edge Delivery Architecture](/help/edge/assets/AEM-forms-with-EDS-publishing.png)

Edge Delivery services is a composable set of services that allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author content on your website. As mentioned previously, you can use both [AEM content management](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/getting-started/concepts.html) with [AEM authoring](/help/implementing/universal-editor/introduction.md) as well as [document-based authoring](https://www.aem.live/docs/authoring)

For example, you can use content directly from Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. This means that content from those sources can become forms on your website. The new content is added instantly without a rebuild process.

Edge Delivery Services uses GitHub so customers can manage and deploy code directly from their GitHub repository. For example, you can write forms in either Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel and the components of your forms can be developed by using CSS and JavaScript in GitHub. When you are ready, you can use the Sidekick browser extension to preview and publish content updates.

AEM Forms Edge Delivery Services provides a forms block, known as [Adaptive Forms block](/help/edge/docs/forms/create-forms.md) to add a form to your Edge Delivery Services site.

It allows you to integrate various input types like text fields, dropdown menus, and radio buttons, enabling you to collect user data effectively. It offers a basic version of rules to add dynamic behaviour to forms. Key features of Document-based authoring are: 

* **[HTML5-based Form Field components](/help/edge/docs/forms/form-components.md)**: AEM Forms Edge Delivery Services allow you to create user-friendly and interactive forms using form components based on HTML5 [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types), <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea">textarea</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select">select</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset">fieldset</a>  elements. These components cater to different types of data collection and can be easily customized to fit your specific needs.  

* **Accessibility**: The fields in the form block are accessible. Each label is linked with its respective input element, and IDs are auto-generated for linking. Descriptions associated with fields are linked via the aria-describedby attribute. Keyboard navigation using the standard Tab/Shift + Tab keys is supported.

* **[Styling](/help/edge/docs/forms/style-theme-forms.md)**: Each form field has a fixed HTML structure that can be easily decorated using custom CSS or JavaScript files. Selectors for targeting fields in CSS and JS are provided based on type and name. You can easily create new selectors due to the standradized structure and style your form. 

* **Basic Rules**: Easily create logic that adjusts field visibility, validation, and behavior based on user input or predefined conditions. Rules offer a flexible and intuitive way to add intelligence to your forms, ensuring they adapt seamlessly based on user inputs.

* **Validations**: Before submission, the form is validated, and invalid fields are appropriately marked with error messages displayed to the user. Adaptive Forms block support all the HTML form validation, supported by modern browsers, and provide additional validation mechanism like validation script, file size, file type, overall file size, and more. 

* **File Uploads**: You can add file attachment capabilities to your forms. Whether you need to gather documents, images, or other files from your users, file upload functionality serves you effortlessly. With custom handling options available, you can tailor the file upload process to suit your specific requirements.

* **reCAPTCHA**: Benefit from seamless integration of Google reCAPTCHA into your forms with our out-of-the-box (OOTB) support. Safeguard your forms against fraudulent activities, spam, and abuse, while maintaining a smooth and uninterrupted user experience. Adaptive Forms block supports reCaptcha V3 and reCaptcha Enterprise. 

* **Send email notification on form submission**: Eliminate the hassle of manual follow-ups and ensure timely communication with our built-in email automation for form submissions. This integrated solution lets you effortlessly notify relevant parties, including sending form data, whenever someone fills out a form on your website. No need for complex configurations or additional tools â€“ it's ready to use out of the box.
