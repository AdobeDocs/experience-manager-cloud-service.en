# AEM Forms Edge Delivery Service 

Streamline form creation and drive higher completion rates with Adobe's AEM Forms Edge Delivery Service. This powerful, composable service empowers you to build enterprise-grade forms with exceptional performance and visual appeal. AEM prioritizes both the user experience and your business goals, ensuring lightning-fast loading times and increased form completions.

You can use the service to:

* **Captivate users with stunning forms**: Build complex and engaging forms with ease using a library of pre-built components. Easily integrate reCAPTCHA, submit forms directly to email, and allow seamless file uploads to secure storage solutions like Sharepoint, Azure Storage, and Amazon S3. Even create your own custom forms components to bring your unique vision to life.

* **Create digital enrollment experiences with tools of your choice**: Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources. Out of the box you can use both document-based authoring (Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace) and AEM authoring (AEM Editors). As such, you can work with multiple content sources on the same website and use your preferred authoring tools, such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Adaptive Forms Editor.

* **Build forms with perfect Lighthouse score**: Build forms that load and render quickly, even on slow internet connections. Faster loading times and optimized user experience contribute to higher form completion rates and improved conversion rates.

## Key capabilities

* **HTML5-based Form Field components**: AEM Forms Edge Delivery Service allows you to create user-friendly and interactive forms using form fields based on valid HTML5 [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types), <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea">textarea</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select">select</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset">fieldset</a>  components. These components cater to different types of data collection and can be easily customized to fit your specific needs.  

* **Accessibility**: The fields in the form block are accessible. Each label is linked with its respective input element, and IDs are auto-generated for linking. Descriptions associated with fields are linked via the aria-describedby attribute. Keyboard navigation using the standard Tab/Shift + Tab keys is supported.

* **Form Rules**: Create logic that adjusts field visibility, validation, and behavior based on user input or predefined conditions. Rules offer a flexible and intuitive way to add intelligence to your forms, ensuring they adapt seamlessly based on user inputs.

* **File Uploads**: Enhance your forms with seamless file attachment capabilities. Whether you need to gather documents, images, or other files from your users, the Adaptive Form Block empowers you to integrate file upload functionality effortlessly. With custom handling options available, you can tailor the file upload process to suit your specific requirements.

* **Form Validation**: Before submission, the form is validated, and invalid fields are appropriately marked with error messages displayed to the user. Various patterns are available for displaying these errors.

* **Styling Forms**: Each form field has a fixed HTML structure that can be further decorated using custom CSS or JavaScript files. Selectors for targeting fields in CSS/JS are provided based on type and name.
