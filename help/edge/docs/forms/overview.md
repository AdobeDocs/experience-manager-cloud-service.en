It allows you to integrate various input types like text fields, dropdown menus, and radio buttons, enabling you to collect user data effectively. It offers a basic version of rules to add dynamic behaviour to forms. Key features of Document-based authoring are: 

* **[HTML5-based Form Field components](/help/edge/docs/forms/form-components.md)**: AEM Forms Edge Delivery Services allow you to create user-friendly and interactive forms using form components based on HTML5 [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types), <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea">textarea</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select">select</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset">fieldset</a>  elements. These components cater to different types of data collection and can be easily customized to fit your specific needs.  

* **Accessibility**: The fields in the form block are accessible. Each label is linked with its respective input element, and IDs are auto-generated for linking. Descriptions associated with fields are linked via the aria-describedby attribute. Keyboard navigation using the standard Tab/Shift + Tab keys is supported.

* **[Styling](/help/edge/docs/forms/style-theme-forms.md)**: Each form field has a fixed HTML structure that can be easily decorated using custom CSS or JavaScript files. Selectors for targeting fields in CSS and JS are provided based on type and name. You can easily create new selectors due to the standradized structure and style your form. 

* **Basic Rules**: Easily create logic that adjusts field visibility, validation, and behavior based on user input or predefined conditions. Rules offer a flexible and intuitive way to add intelligence to your forms, ensuring they adapt seamlessly based on user inputs.

* **Validations**: Before submission, the form is validated, and invalid fields are appropriately marked with error messages displayed to the user. Adaptive Forms block support all the HTML form validation, supported by modern browsers, and provide additional validation mechanism like validation script, file size, file type, overall file size, and more.
