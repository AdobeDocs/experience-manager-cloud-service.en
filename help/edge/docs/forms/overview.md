AEM Forms Edge Delivery Service is a composable service offered by Adobe that allows you to create and deliver high-impact, fast-performing web forms. 

![EDS Forms Key features](/help/edge/assets/eds-forms-key-features.png)

You can use the service to:

* **Captivate users with stunning forms**: Build complex and engaging forms with ease using a library of pre-built components. Easily integrate reCAPTCHA, submit forms directly to email, and allow seamless file uploads to secure storage solutions like Sharepoint, Azure Storage, and Amazon S3. Even create your own custom forms components to bring your unique vision to life.

* **Create digital enrollment experiences with tools of your choice**: Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources. Out of the box you can use both document-based authoring (Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace) and AEM authoring (AEM Editors). As such, you can work with multiple content sources on the same website and use your preferred authoring tools, such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Adaptive Forms Editor.

* **Build forms with perfect Lighthouse score**: Build forms that load and render quickly, even on slow internet connections. Faster loading times and optimized user experience contribute to higher form completion rates and improved conversion rates.
