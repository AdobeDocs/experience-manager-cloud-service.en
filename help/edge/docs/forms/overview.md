## Key Features

* **HTML5-based Form Field components**: AEM Forms Edge Delivery Service allows you to create user-friendly and interactive forms using form components based on HTML5 [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types), <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea">textarea</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select">select</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset">fieldset</a>  elements. These components cater to different types of data collection and can be easily customized to fit your specific needs.  

* **Accessibility**: The fields in the form block are accessible. Each label is linked with its respective input element, and IDs are auto-generated for linking. Descriptions associated with fields are linked via the aria-describedby attribute. Keyboard navigation using the standard Tab/Shift + Tab keys is supported.

* **Styling**: Each form field has a fixed HTML structure that can be easily decorated using custom CSS or JavaScript files. Selectors for targeting fields in CSS and JS are provided based on type and name. You can easily create new selectors due to the standradized structure. 

* **Rules**: Easily create logic that adjusts field visibility, validation, and behavior based on user input or predefined conditions. Rules offer a flexible and intuitive way to add intelligence to your forms, ensuring they adapt seamlessly based on user inputs.

* **Validations**: Before submission, the form is validated, and invalid fields are appropriately marked with error messages displayed to the user. Various patterns are available for displaying these errors.

There are some advanced features which are available on request:  

* **File Uploads**: You can add file attachment capabilities to your forms. Whether you need to gather documents, images, or other files from your users, file upload functionality serves you effortlessly. With custom handling options available, you can tailor the file upload process to suit your specific requirements.

* **reCAPTCHA**: Benefit from seamless integration of Google reCAPTCHA into your forms with our out-of-the-box (OOTB) support. Safeguard your forms against fraudulent activities, spam, and abuse, while maintaining a smooth and uninterrupted user experience. 

* **Send email notification on form submission**: Eliminate the hassle of manual follow-ups and ensure timely communication with our built-in email automation for form submissions. This integrated solution lets you effortlessly notify relevant parties, including sending form data, whenever someone fills out a form on your website. No need for complex configurations or additional tools â€“ it's ready to use out of the box.


## Available Forms Blocks

AEM Forms Edge Delivery Service offers two types of forms blocks to cater to different needs:

* **Basic Forms Block**: This is a versatile option suitable for creating simple forms with essential functionalities. It allows you to integrate various input types like text fields, dropdown menus, and radio buttons, enabling you to collect user data effectively.

* **Adaptive Forms Block**: This advanced block unlocks additional capabilities beyond the Basic Forms Block, empowering you to build more complex and interactive forms. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

    * Rules: Define logic-based actions within your forms. You can use rules to conditionally show or hide form sections, pre-populate fields based on user input, and perform various validations to ensure data integrity.
    
    * Server-side extensibility: Extend the functionalities of your forms by integrating them with server-side logic. This allows you to perform complex calculations, interact with external systems, and automate specific tasks based on user actions within the form.

    * Cross Walk: Streamline workflows and data management: Leverage the power of AEM to:
    
         * Design user-friendly forms using AEM editors.
        
         * Generate a "Document of Record" for secure and tamper-proof archiving of submitted data.
         
         * Facilitate e-signing with Adobe Sign for a smooth and secure signing experience.
        
         * Automate business processes through AEM workflows, triggering actions based on form submissions.
         
         * Effortlessly integrate with various data sources, enabling seamless data flow and exchange.

    Using the Adaptive Forms Block requires an additional license.

### Choosing the right Forms Block

The selection between the Basic and Adaptive Forms Blocks depends on your specific requirements. If you need a straightforward solution for collecting basic user information, the Basic Forms Block is a perfect fit. However, if your forms require intricate logic, data manipulation, integration with external systems, or streamlined workflows using AEM features, and **you have the necessary license**, the Adaptive Forms Block provides the necessary power and flexibility to achieve your goals.
