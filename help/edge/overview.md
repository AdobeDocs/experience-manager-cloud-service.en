# Edge Delivery Services Introduction {#introduction-edge}

With Edge Delivery, AEM delivers exceptional experiences that drive engagement and conversions. AEM does so by delivering fast performant experiences that are fast to author and develop. As such, with the help of Edge Delivery Services you can improve conversion, reduce costs and increase velocity. Keep in mind that Edge Delivery Services is a composable set of services that are used **in addition** to the usual [AEM authoring methods](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/authoring/essentials/author.html) and do not replace the authoring workflows commonly used by customers up to this point.

By leveraging Edge Delivery you can:

* Create fast sites with a perfect Lighthouse Score and continuously monitor your site performance through real user monitoring (RUM).
* Edit content in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Microsoft Excel, and Google Sheets as well as any custom authoring environment and AEMs Universal Editor. The content can then be incorporated and rendered on the fly without the need for a lenghty rebuild process.
* Use a built-in experimentation framework that allows quick test creation, execution without performance impact and fast release to production of a test winner.

The following diagram illustrates how you can edit content in Microsoft Word (Document-based editing) and publish to Edge Delivery. It also shows the traditional AEM publishing method using the various editors.

Edge Delivery Services are a part of Adobe Experience Manager and as such Edge Delivery and AEM sites can co-exist on the same domain. This is usually a common use case for larger websites. On top of that, content from Edge Delivery can easily be consumed in your AEM Sites pages and vice-versa.

You can also use Edge Delivery Services in combination with Adobe Target, Analytics and Launch.
