# Edge Delivery Services Overview {#edge-delivery-services}

With Edge Delivery Services, AEM delivers exceptional experiences that drive engagement and conversions. AEM does so by delivering high-impact experiences that are fast to author and develop. It is a composable set of services that enables a rapid development environment where authors can update and publish quickly, and new sites are launched rapidly. As such, with Edge Delivery Services you can improve conversion, reduce costs, and provide extreme content velocity.

By using Edge Delivery Services, you can:

* Create fast sites with a perfect Lighthouse Score and continuously monitor your site performance through real use monitoring (RUM).
* Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources. Out of the box you can use both WYSIWYG and document-based authoring. As such, you can work with multiple content sources on the same website.
* Use a built-in experimentation framework that allows quick test creation, execution without performance impact and fast release to production of a test winner.

## Agile Reaction to Business Needs {#agile-reaction}

As a longstanding recognized industry leader, Adobe knows how important it is to be able to quickly create and publish new, meaningful content for your customers. Common challenges in scaling content creation have been made clear by the market, including:

1. **Demand for content continues to grow.**
   * There is a need to unlock new content authors to meet this demand.
   * The content creation process must scale effectively across the business.
   * Authors must be able to react quickly to changing trends.
1. **There is a need for omni-channel content.**
   * Layout control is needed irrespective of content delivery.
   * Authors need to be empowered to change content layout directly.
1. **Pressure grows to drive ROI on content.**
   * Authors themselves need the ability to optimize the content that they create.

These trends have proved themselves consistent across the industry. However individual requirements inevitably vary project to project. The goal of any Edge Delivery Services project is focused on finding the solution that works for your users.

1. **Focus on value instead of features.** - Determine the most optimized workflow to serve your authors rather than getting lost in AEM's expansive feature set.
1. **Take advantage of AEM's flexibility.** - AEM features don't need to be used in a vacuum. Use those features that you need per use case.
1. **Leverage your author's expertise.** - Involve real content authors in the project from the beginning to ensure you are delivering the value they need by implementing the features that make sense.

By focusing on value for your authors, your Edge Delivery Services project can meet the modern industry demands facing your content creators and provide content quickly to delight your customers.

## Flexible Authoring Tools for Your Content Creators {#overview}

Edge Delivery Services is a composable set of services that allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author content on your website. You can use both [AEM content management](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/getting-started/concepts.html) and WYSIWYG authoring using the [Universal Editor](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/universal-editor/authoring.md) as well as [document-based authoring.](https://www.aem.live/docs/authoring)

The following diagram illustrates how you can edit content in Microsoft Word (document-based authoring) and publish to Edge Delivery Services. It also shows the WYSIWYG editing using the Universal Editor.

![Edge Delivery Architecture](assets/AEM-with-EDS-publishing-simple2.png)

Edge Delivery Services uses GitHub so you can manage and deploy code directly from your GitHub repository. New content is added instantly without a rebuild process.

### Document-Based Authoring {#document-based}

With document-based authoring, you can use content directly from Microsoft Word or Google Docs such that those sources become pages on your website. Headings, lists, images, font elements can all be transferred from the initial source into the website.

* With document-based authoring, every marketer is enabled to create content quickly with known authoring tools (Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.).
* Content creation is streamlined by allowing authoring, review, and publishing directly within the source documents.
* Because known tools are used, zero onboarding is required for content authors, increasing content velocity.
* The functionality of your site can be developed by using CSS and JavaScript in GitHub.

### WYSIWYG Authoring {#wysiwyg-authoring}

What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) authoring leverages the Universal Editor, a customizable, one-stop place to edit content live and in-context with a visual preview.

* With WYSIWYG authoring, you increase author efficiency whether headless or headful.
* You can take advantage of AEM's comprehensive content-management capabilities including workflow and governance.
* Leverage numerous extension points to support your own processes and integrations.
* The functionality of your site can be developed by using CSS and JavaScript in GitHub.

### Deciding on Your Authoring Method {#authoring-method}

AEM's flexibility ensures that your authoring needs are covered. Adobe can help you determine what method (or methods) best fit your requirements.

* Always involve your content authors in the decision.
* Multiple authoring methods can be implemented.
* You can always change your authoring method after-the-fact.
* You mustn't decide before the implementation, but rather as part of the implementation.

Please see the document [Choosing an Authoring Method](authoring-methods.md) for more information.
