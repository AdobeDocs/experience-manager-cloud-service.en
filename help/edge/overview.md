With Edge Delivery Services, AEM delivers exceptional experiences that drive engagement and conversions. AEM does so by delivering high-impact experiences that are fast to author and develop. It is a composable set of services that enables a rapid development environments where authors can update and publish quickly, and new sites are launched rapidly. As such, with Edge Delivery Services you can improve conversion, reduce costs and provide extreme content velocity.

By leveraging Edge Delivery you can:

* Create fast sites with a perfect Lighthouse Score and continuously monitor your site performance through real user monitoring (RUM).
* Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources. Out of the box you can use both AEM authoring and document-based authoring. As such, you can work with multiple content sources on the same website.
* Use a built-in experimentation framework that allows quick test creation, execution without performance impact and fast release to production of a test winner.

## How Edge Delivery works{#edge-works}

The following diagram illustrates how you can edit content in Microsoft Word (document-based editing) and publish to Edge Delivery. It also shows the traditional AEM publishing method using the various editors.

Edge Delivery is a composable set of services that allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author content on your website. As mentioned previously, you can use both [AEM authoring](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/getting-started/concepts.html) and [document based authoring](https://www.hlx.live/docs/authoring).

For example, you can use content directly from Microsoft Word or Goggle Docs. This means that documents from those sources can become pages on your website. Furthermore, headings, lists, images, font elements can all be transferred from the initial source into the website. The new content will be added instantly without a rebuild process.

Edge Delivery leverages Github so customers can manage and deploy code directly from their Github repository. For example, you can write content in either Google Docs or Microsoft Word and the functionality of your site can be developed by using CSS and Javascript in GitHub . When you are ready, you can use the Sidekick browser extension to preview and publish content updates.
