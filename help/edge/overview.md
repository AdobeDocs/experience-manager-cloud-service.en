>[!NOTE]

>This is a draft, feel free to update/modify as needed.

With Edge Delivery, AEM delivers exceptional experiences that drive engagement and conversions. AEM does so by delivering fast performant experiences that are fast to author and develop. It is a composable set of services that helps create sites that are fast, helps authors to publish quickly, and gets new sites launched rapidly. As such, with Edge Delivery Services you can improve conversion, reduce costs and increase velocity.  Keep in mind that Edge Delivery Services  are used **in addition** to the usual [AEM authoring methods](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/authoring/essentials/author.html) and do not replace the authoring workflows commonly used by customers.

By leveraging Edge Delivery you can:

* Create fast sites with a perfect Lighthouse Score and continuously monitor your site performance through real user monitoring (RUM).
* Edit content in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Microsoft Excel, and Google Sheets as well as any custom authoring environment and AEMs Universal Editor. The content can then be incorporated and rendered on the fly without the need for a lenghty rebuild process.
* Use a built-in experimentation framework that allows quick test creation, execution without performance impact and fast release to production of a test winner.

## How Edge Delivery works{#edge-works}

The following diagram illustrates how you can edit content in Microsoft Word (Document-based editing) and publish to Edge Delivery. It also shows the traditional AEM publishing method using the various editors.

As mentioned previously, Edge Delivery is a composable set of services used in addition to the usual AEM authoring methods. This allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author or update content for your website. For example, you can use content directly from Microsoft Word or Goggle Docs. This means that documents from those sources can become pages on your website. Furthermore, headings, lists, images, font elements can all be transferred from the initial source into the website. The new content will be added instantly without a rebuild process.

Edge Delivery leverages Github to allow customers to manage and deploy code and updates directly from their Github repository. For example, you can write content in Google Docs or Microsoft Word then the functionality of your site can be developed by using CSS and Javascript in GitHub . When you are ready, you can use the Sidekick browser extension to preview and publish the content updates.

For further details on how to get started see the [Build](https://www.hlx.live/docs/#build) section of the Edge delivery documentation. To understand how to author and publish content by using Edge Delivery see the [Publish section](https://www.hlx.live/docs/authoring). Finally, to understand how to properly launch your website project see the [Launch section](https://www.hlx.live/docs/#launch).

## Edge Delivery Services and other Adobe Experience Cloud products {#edge-other-products}

Edge Delivery Services are part of Adobe Experience Manager and as such Edge Delivery and AEM sites can co-exist on the same domain. This is a common use case for larger websites. On top of that, content from Edge Delivery can easily be consumed in your AEM Sites pages and vice-versa.

You can also use Edge Delivery Services in combination with Adobe Target, Analytics and Launch.
