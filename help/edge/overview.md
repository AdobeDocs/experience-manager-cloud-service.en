# Edge Delivery Services Overview {#edge-delivery-services}

With Edge Delivery Services, AEM delivers exceptional experiences that drive engagement and conversions. AEM does so by delivering high-impact experiences that are fast to author and develop. It is a composable set of services that enables a rapid development environment where authors can update and publish quickly, and new sites are launched rapidly. As such, with Edge Delivery Services you can improve conversion, reduce costs, and provide extreme content velocity.

By using Edge Delivery Services, you can:

* Create fast sites with a perfect Lighthouse Score and continuously monitor your site performance through real use monitoring (RUM).
* Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources. Out of the box you can use both AEM authoring and Document-based Authoring . As such, you can work with multiple content sources on the same website.
* Use a built-in experimentation framework that allows quick test creation, execution without performance impact and fast release to production of a test winner.

## Overview {#overview}

Edge Delivery Services is a composable set of services that allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author content on your website. You can use both [AEM content management](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/getting-started/concepts.html) and AEM-based authoring using the [Universal Editor](/help/sites-cloud/authoring/universal-editor/authoring.md) as well as [document-based authoring.](https://www.aem.live/docs/authoring)

The following diagram illustrates how you can edit content in Microsoft Word (document-based authoring) and publish to Edge Delivery Services. It also shows the AEM-based editing using the Universal Editor.

You can use content directly from Microsoft Word or Google Docs such that those sources become pages on your website. Furthermore, headings, lists, images, font elements can all be transferred from the initial source into the website. The new content is added instantly without a rebuild process.

Edge Delivery Services uses GitHub so you can manage and deploy code directly from your GitHub repository. For example, you write content in either Google Docs or Microsoft Word and the functionality of your site can be developed by using CSS and JavaScript in GitHub. When you are ready, you use the Sidekick browser extension to preview and publish content updates.
