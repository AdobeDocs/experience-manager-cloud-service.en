With Edge Delivery, authoring is easy, fast, and flexible. You can take two different paths to authoring within the context of Edge Delivery Services:

* Document-based authoring (such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs) - [Refer to this link for more details](https://www.hlx.live/docs/authoring).
* Page Editor/Universal Editor - Contact your Adobe Sales Representative.

In the case of document-based authoring, you can work with a variety of sources such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Documents from these sources become pages on your website. Headings, lists, images, font elements, videos can all be transferred from the initial source into your website. You can add metadata for SEO purposes or use blocks to work with structured content and add functionality.
