# Using Edge Delivery Services with AEM {#usingedge}

With Edge Delivery Services, you can create rapid development environments where authors can update and publish content quickly, and new sites can be launched rapidly. To this end, you can work with multiple content sources on the same website and publishing will be seamless and streamlined regardless of you chosen source. As such, it takes only a couple of seconds to go from editing to seeing the content live on the internet.

Edge Delivery Services is decoupled from the content source and can ingest content from different content sources.

Ingesting from multiple content sources offers maximum flexibility to the user. Adobe offers guidance to help you choose which content sources are the best fit for your project.

There are cases where the content source is predefined or otherwise not flexible (e.g. the project can not use Sharepoint or Google Drive). But in many cases, the tool is not preordained and choice of tool is not black and white.

Adobe's guiding principle is simplicity. Start with Document-based Authoring  and add complexity when needed. If a tool change is needed, AEM's Edge Delivery Services integration covers content migration.
