# Repoless Stage and Prod Environments {#repoless-stage-prod}

Learn how to set up a separate sites for your staging and production environments leveraging a single code base in a repoless manner.

## Overview {#overview}

You may wish to set up a site for your production environment separate from your staging environment. Setting up a second site for a separate staging and production setup is similar to the [setup required for multi site management.](/help/edge/wysiwyg-authoring/repoless-msm.md) In fact, it can be combined with MSM site structures if required.

## Setup {#setup}

The following steps describe how to set up a separate production site for your project using the same code base. The following assumptions are made.

* The staging site is already set up and you now want to create a configuration for the production site.
* The content structure in AEM authoring are similar.
* The same path mappings will be used for staging and production.
