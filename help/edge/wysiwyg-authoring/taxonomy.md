# Managing Taxonomy Data {#managing-taxonomy-data}

Learn how to manage taxonomy data for using tags with your AEM with Edge Delivery Services sites.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Tagging is an important feature that helps you organize and manage your pages. [The Tagging Console](/help/sites-cloud/administering/tags.md) in AEM allows you to create a rich taxonomy of tags to organize your pages.

These tags are useful not only for you and your authors in organizing your content, but of course for your readers as well. Tags and their taxonomy can be used in components on the page to help your readers navigate your content.

The Universal Editor works only with the IDs of your tags. By creating a taxonomy page for your content, you expose the descriptions of these tags to the Universal Editor so it can use the information when rendering content.
