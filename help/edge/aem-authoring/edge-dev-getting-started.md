# Developer Getting Started Guide for AEM Authoring with Edge Delivery Services {#edge-dev-getting-started}

This guide will get you up-and-running with a new Adobe Experience Manager site using Edge Delivery Services and the Universal Editor for content authoring.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before beginning this guide, you should already be familiar with the basics of and have access to Edge Delivery Services including:

* You have completed the [Edge Delivery Service tutorial.](/help/edge/developer/tutorial.md)
* You have access to an [AEM Cloud Service sandbox.](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/getting-access-to-aem-in-cloud/introduction-sandbox-programs.md)
* You have [enabled the Universal Editor on the same sandbox environment.](/help/implementing/universal-editor/getting-started.md)

## Pick the Right Editor {#editor-choice}

AEM offers two different content editors and the choice of which to use depends on your situation.

* **Universal Editor** - This should be the default choice for new sites.
* **AEM Page Editor** - This should be chosen for an existing AEM Sites migration to Edge Delivery Services.

This guide focuses on AEM projects on Edge Delivery Services using the Universal Editor. See the document [Using Edge Delivery Services with AEM](/help/edge/using.md) for more details on choosing the right editor and the migration of existing AEM sites to Edge Delivery Services.

## Core Concepts when Developing for Edge Delivery Services {#core-concepts}

Edge Delivery Services is based around the concept of blocks. AEM comes with a comprehensive library of predefined blocks, which can be extended to meet your project needs. Code for Edge Delivery Services projects is managed in GitHub.

### Blocks {#blocks}

Blocks are the most fundamental part of a page delivered by Edge Delivery Services. A block encapsulates styling and code that drives a logical component of a content page.

AEM provides standard blocks as part of the product within the project boilerplate. Such blocks include heading, text, images, links, lists, etc.

>[!TIP]
>
>Please see the [Build section](/help/edge/developer/block-collection.md) of the Edge Delivery Services documentation for more details on blocks and how to develop for Edge Delivery services.

### Edge Delivery Services and GitHub {#github-edge}

Edge Delivery leverages GitHub so you can manage and deploy code directly from your GitHub repository.

Your authors can create content using either Document-based Authoring  or content in AEM with the Universal Editor. Developers can customize the functionality of your site by using CSS and JavaScript in GitHub regardless of how the authors create their content.

Websites are automatically created for each of your branches from content preview to production. Every resource that you put into your GitHub repository is available on your website without a build process.

>Please see the [Build section](/help/edge/developer/block-collection.md) of the Edge Delivery Services documentation for more details on blocks and how to develop for Edge Delivery services.

## Getting Started with AEM Authoring and Edge Delivery Services {#getting-started}

Once you have fulfilled [the prerequisites](#prerequisites) and have made [the choice to use the Universal Editor,](#editor-choice) you can get started on your own project.

### Create Your GitHub Project {#create-github-project}

First you will need to create a new project on GitHub, based on the Adobe template.

1. Navigate to [`https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xwalk`](https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xwalk) and Click on **Use this template** and select **Create a new repository**.

   * You will need to be signed in to GitHub to see this option.

   ![Copy repository project](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/use-template-project.png)

1. By default, the repository will be assigned to you. Change this as necessary as well as provide a repository name and description and click **Create repository**.

   ![Creating the repository](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/create-repo.png)

1. In a new tab in the same browser, navigate to [`https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync`](https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync) and click **Configure**.

   ![Code Sync](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/configure-code-sync.png)

1. Click **Configure** for the org where you created your new repository in the previous step.

   ![Choosing the org for code sync](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/code-sync-org.png)

1. On the AEM Code Sync GitHub page under **Repository access**, select **Only select repositories**, select the repository that you created in the previous step, and then click **Save**.

   ![Granting AEM Code Sync access](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/grant-code-sync-acces.png)

1. Once AEM Code Sync is installed, you receive a confirmation screen. Return to the browser tab of your new repository.

   ![Code Sync installation confirmation](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/confirmation.png)

1. Click the `fstab.yaml` file to open it and then the **Edit this file** icon to edit it.

   ![fstab.yaml](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/fstab.png)

1. Edit the `fstab.yaml` file to update the mount point of your project. Replace the default Google Docs URL with the URL of your AEM as a Cloud Service authoring instance and then click **Commit changes...**.

   * `https://<aem-author>/bin/franklin.delivery/<owner>/<repository>/main`
   * Changing the mount point tells Edge Delivery Services where to find the content of the site.
   
   ![Updating fstab](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/fstab-update.png)

1. Add a commit message as desired and then click **Commit changes**, committing them directly to the `main` branch.

   ![Committing changes](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/commit-fstab-changes.png)

1. Return to the root of your repository and click on `paths.json` and then the **Edit this file** icon.

   ![paths.json](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/paths.png)

1. The default mapping will use the name of the repository. Update the default mapping as required for your project with `/content/<site-name>/:/` and click **Commit changes...**.

   * Provide your own `<site-name>`. You will need it in a later step.
   * The mappings tells Edge Delivery Services how to map the content in your AEM repository to the site URL.

   ![Updating paths.json](assets/edge-dev-getting-started/paths-update.png)

1. Add a commit message as desired and then click **Commit changes**, committing them directly to the `main` branch.
