With Edge Delivery, you can create rapid development environments where authors can update and publish quickly, and new sites can be launched rapidly. You can work with multiple content sources on the same website and publishing will be seamless and streamlined regardless of you chosen source. It takes only a couple of seconds to go from editing to seeing the content live on the internet.

## Edge Delivery Services and Github {#github-edge}

Edge Delivery leverages Github and uses a buildless approach that runs directly from your GitHub repository. This means that websites are automatically created for each of your branches from content preview to production. Every resource that you put into your GitHub repository will available on your website without a build process.

## Using the Sidekick {#using-sidekick}

​​The AEM sidekick provides a toolbar with context-aware options so you can easily edit, preview, and publish content. After [installing](https://www.hlx.live/docs/sidekick-extension) the AEM sidekick extension it can be used either in project environments or when you edit your content (for example, in Google Docs). It has several actions available like: Preview, Reload, Edit and Publish. You can also switch environments when using the sidekick going from preview to production and vice-versa. To publish, open the sidekick on a preview page and use the Publish action. After you click Publish, the current preview version of the page will be available in live and production environments.
