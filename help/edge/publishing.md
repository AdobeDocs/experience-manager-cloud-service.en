With Edge Delivery, you can create rapid development environment where authors can update and publish quickly, and new sites can be launched rapidly. Since you can work with multiple content sources on the same website, publishing is seamless and streamlined regardless of you chosen source.

## Edge Delivery Services and Github {#github-edge}

Edge Delivery leverages Github so customers can manage and deploy code directly from their Github repository. Edge Delivery uses a buildless approach that runs directly from your GitHub repository. This means that after installing the AEM GitHub bot on your repository, websites are automatically created for each of your branches from content preview to production. Every resource that you put into your GitHub repository is available on your website.

## Using the Sidekick {#using-sidekick}

​​​​The AEM sidekick provides content authors with a toolbar offering context-aware options so that they can edit, preview, and publish their content directly from the website pages. After [installing](https://www.hlx.live/docs/sidekick-extension) the AEM sidekick extension it can be invoked in project environments or when you edit your content (for example, in Google docs or Microsoft word). It has several actions available like: Preview, Reload, Edit and Publish. You can also switch environments dynamically when using the sidekick by going from preview to production and vice-versa. To publish, use the Publish action that is available in all three environments and it makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
