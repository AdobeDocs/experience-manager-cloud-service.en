## Use Cases {#use-cases}

In any AEM with Edge Delivery Services project, there is a need to maintain lists of value mappings. These can be lists of many different values such as metadata and redirects. Edge Deliver Services allows you to maintain such lists using an intuitive tool: the spreadsheet. AEM translates these spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel workbooks and Google Sheets) into JSON files that can easily be consumed by your website or web application. This enables many uses for content that is table-oriented or structured.

You can use AEM as a Cloud Service to create spreadsheets to manage key-value mappings of any kind. Common use cases include:

* [Placeholders](/help/edge/docs/placeholders.md)
* [Metadata](/help/edge/docs/bulk-metadata.md)
* Configurations
* [Headers](/help/edge/docs/custom-headers.md)
* [Redirects](/help/edge/docs/redirects.md)

In addition, you can create spreadsheets of any structure to store mappings for your own purposes.

This document uses the example of redirects to illustrate how to create such spreadsheets. See the previously-linked topics in the Edge Delivery Services documentation for details of each use case.
